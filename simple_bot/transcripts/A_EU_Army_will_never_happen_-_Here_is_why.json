    "transcription": "with an aggressive Russia to the east an unreliable United States to the west and an unpredictable China to the Far East calls for a United European Army are becoming louder within the EU in a previous video Linked In the description below I have analyzed why a European Army seems inevitable in this video however we will turn things around and analyze why a European Army is unlikely to happen for this I have identified three reasons the first reason is the duplication of NATO NATO is an intergovernmental military Alliance made up of 30 members the EU currently has 27 members and 21 of those members are also part of NATO this is quite a significant overlap and there are concerns whether a European Army and NATO can efficiently work side by side without weakening another and this is what yens stoltenberg the Secretary General of NATO is worried about he has urged Europeans to avoid duplicating NATO as money invested in an EU Army would be money lost for the alliance he also claimed that the UK Canada and us are essential for EU defense and that an EU Army May weaken this relationship and he's not alone some of the EU member states have echoed this rhetoric there's a clear ideological divide within the EU on one side you have the so-called gists who Advocate a strong and independent Europe on the other side you have the at atlanticists who want to protect NATO's role in Europe and favor the us as the core security provider in Europe and this leads perfectly to the second reason political opposition now before continuing I would really like to ask you for a quick favor if you like the video please subscribe hit the Bell icon and like the video I have only started creating content a month ago and your support will really help me grow thanks back to reason two political opposition for most foreign policy decisions within Europe you need unanimous agreement from all the countries meaning that each of the 27 EU countries have a veto as history has shown this makes things very difficult a proposal for a European Army has not even been created yet and multiple EU countries have already declared their opposition take Denmark who claimed that an EU Army will come at the expense of NATO other states such as Poland latva and Malta have also expressed similar views even Germany with their new Chancellor Olaf Schulz is not as vocal about the European Army as his predater Angela Merkel and M the biggest proponent faces elections in April and if Le or zamore were to win then Europe can forget about the idea of an EU Army altogether but even if the EU countries would miraculously agree to draw up a proposal there are so many questions and problems that need to be addressed who who will fund it who will run it who will control it the issue here lies around power if the eu's executive pillar the European commission would have the control then the ultimate power would lie in Brussels with its president currently Ura underline a second option is creating a new military pillar within the EU independent from the executive but the same problem persists who would control it some would point to Germany or France as they pay most into the budget but then again it will be near to impossible to get all member states to agree on this the third reason is foreign policy sovereignty especially when it comes to military deployment the lack of a shared Vision how to use EU forces would be an enormous problem in a crisis once again each member state has a veto the EU has learned this the hard way EU battle groups created in 2007 these consist of rotating Troop conents from member states in theory ready to deploy a 10 days notice however even though they have had a 15-year lifespan they have never been used they came close a couple of times such as in 2013 for a mission into the Central African Republic however a single country vetoed that idea therefore governments would be foolish to give up sovereignty to Brussels as they can no longer decide where to deploy without the approval from 26 other members M States so there you have it the three reasons why a European Army is unlikely to happen as mentioned earlier I have also created a video with the three reasons why an EU Army is inevitable see the link in the description below let me know in the comments if you feel there are other reasons that I may have left out"
