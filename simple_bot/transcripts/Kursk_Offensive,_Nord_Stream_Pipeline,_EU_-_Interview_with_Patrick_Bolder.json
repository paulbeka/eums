    "transcription": "e e e e too so great to have you there too and everyone else that's in the comments okay hello everyone and uh yes we had a little technical issue I can already see in the comments no sound lambertus uh but hopefully now you can hear me um and we're very excited I think this is our seventh live stream and it's great to see all of you here already imra I can see you here BGC I can see you there I've seen you in all of the live streams' done so far so great to have you here again and remember this is a interactive live stream so questions argue whatever you want everything is possible here and today we have a awesome topic so as you know in the last two weeks there's been a Ukraine Invasion into kskk which is in Russia of course and this is a big development in the Russia Ukraine war and we're going to dive right into it after I introduce my guest which I'll get to in a minute the next topic we we have is the northstream pipeline that we're going to talk about there's some new developments there and then lastly we're going to look at NATO a little bit and the EU and also drone Warfare which is an interesting little nugget at the end of the live stream and I am joined today by an amazing guest we're very very excited to have him on it's uh Patrick Boulder and um he's a retired lieutenant Colo from the uh Royal Netherlands Air Force and he's also a strategic adviser for defense and security at the he Center for strategic studies sorry I had to look quickly how the University was called again but um Patrick amazing to have you here thank you so much for joining us hi lber yeah no problem I'm glad to be on this channel and explain a little for very well informed public already I guess but um always good to tell some more and uh give some background to uh recent developments yeah because I mean you you are pretty much an expert on the topic if I'm not misunderstanding um you have a book that you have not co-authored but you've written a couple of chapters right on this exact issue is that correct maybe you want to show the public yeah well it's it's a book which has been published by the Netherlands defense Academy or edited by the Netherlands defense Academy and I've written one of the chapters within that together with uh Professor Dr lonica paper comp and it's about the the use of the space domain uh during the Ukraine Russia War um as of February 2022 um how is the space domain being used by by both parties but especially what are the new things there uh what can we learn from it and um well there's conclusion space is there to stay especially in Warfare and um I recommend the chapter it's it's it's about 20 Pages it's easy reading and it's um I think it's enlightening as well great uh we need to make sure that we link the the book at the uh in in the video yeah so we'll we'll do that we'll do that during this this this stream so let's without further Ado Patrick I'd love to go into the details with you because we have 45 minutes it's not too long to discuss such a complex topic and I have a map in front of me so as you can tell everyone this is Ukraine and I'm going to zoom in a little bit and here we have a small blue area and for anyone that's been living under a rock what's happened since August the 6th um Ukraine has well I mean I guess invaded Russia um a small part as you can see here on the map and Patrick my first question is what are your thoughts was this expected or or what are your thoughts about this whole debacle yeah well no it certainly wasn't expected and it was conducted and conceived under the greatest secrecy um because well everything you say and tell and plan with your partners your International Partners um will lead out anyhow and and we know that within the American establishment the ties with the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal are very close so any negative information can just fly over into the public domain so the Ukraine Ukrainian military staff and the presidency himself they were involved in the planning of this operation and nobody else they kept a close lit on it um well and that's logical of course because the main um issue to make sure your opponent is on the wrong footing is by surprising him and it really was surprise also for me but also an understandable surprise because we saw that the frontals frontal areas in the East and in the south of Ukraine nothing really much happened um there was a lot of fighting but mainly static fighting uh trench warfare for almost two years already or for already two years even and Ukraine was gradually losing a little bit of terrain Russia was GR L winning a little bit of terrain a football field each day or something like that at tremendous cost by the way um so something new had to happen in order to give Ukraine new chances to make sure that the ukrainians themselves believed um this war could turn around in their favor and such an incursion into Russian area that was something well nobody really expected and it really turned the Dynamics in favor of Ukraine and that and that's what we see you can think about what are the the goals Ukraine wants to reach with that well first of all of course it's surprise it's slapping Putin in the face Putin is saying he must keep Russia safe by invading Ukraine and by creating a buffer zone in Ukraine um I'm sorry about that no problem no problem buffer zone in Ukraine yeah um in order to keep sui area safe and the Sumi area is right here right let's just just south of the the incursion area yeah yeah so everyone this is sui and here is the buffer zone that's yeah it's it's they call it oblast which is another name for province um so so two goals already um making sure that the Russian public sees that Putin is not the strong leader he pretends to be he cannot keep Russia safe is creating a buffer zone but also in order to get a ukrainians out the Russian army has to deploy other units in order to fight back and these other units have to come somewhere from well almost 100% of Russian army involved with the war in the eastn in the south of Ukraine so those units have to move from the the active Z zones in the war towards uh K and and Brians and belgrad region uh in order to fight the ukrainians back and that means there's less pressure on the frontal areas we don't see that yet but probably in a two weeks we can see that because those units pulled away there are not the units who are currently fighting with the ukrainians right these are the follow on units so when the first units which are now fighting first Russian units now fighting um are getting tired are getting depleted of their men and means um the follow on forces should come but if those follow on forces go all the way back to the kusk area they can't take over the fight right and in the meantime whil they're on the move they can also not join the fight so we see um a gradual decrease of the active fighting uh able formations of Russia um P Patrick maybe maybe if I could just challenge like a little bit of this because it seems like a good move but isn't it dangerous to tickle the bear so to speak because I mean it is Russia we're talking about and it is a nuclear power and um yeah I mean do you see a big risk here because I see a big risk I guess well the first risk is of course if this Ukrainian incursion would go wrong they offer a lot of they they suffer a lot of losses in in men and in material and they have less in order to defend themselves um if the Russians don't react to it um the Russian the Ukrainian forces are um deployed in another area than from from where they can support their offensive against the Russians the fight against the Russians in order to push them out of their own country and yeah sure it's also but that's that's the mean Ukrainian forces are now also um uh editing on Internet that they are looking for Russian red lines but after what's it now two and a half weeks almost they haven't found any red lines on the Russian side yet so um and they keep looking and they go further looking um and that says well you're absolutely right because an invasion into the Russian area might trigger um within the nuclear doctrine of Russia uh to answer with nuclear weapons um but we haven't seen that so all these claims which have been made already two years by the Russians about Western Aid which would trigger probably a nuclear war or the delivery of the tanks or the delivery of the f-16s right it's always big talk but no action so but in your expertise right I mean you're you're let's say an definitely compared to me you're a massive military expert is there is there red lines is there a point you think that that could happen where Russia does I mean I guess press the button it's a stupid an analogy but you know what I mean is is there is there red lines do you believe it's it's becoming less and less clear if if the if if there's a red line concerning the use of nuclear weapons right um probably Russia will refrain from using them because they will put on the big pressure by the Indian president by the Chinese president which is really who has really big influence on Putin and also by the Americans they already said in an early stage of the war that if you start uh with nuclear weapons we will destroy Russia and not probably in a nuclear weapons way but in a cyber domain in the um electronic warfare domain um putting out all the lights and all over Russia by by cyber warfare um and that's possible the Americans can do that also with the support of other NATO Nations so the use of nuclear weapons you can't rule it out but threshold is very high to do that much higher than uh this incursion is or the delivery of Weapons Systems is right maybe if if Ukraine would go all the way to K take the nuclear reactor or March all the way up to Moscow then things will change but I think KK is not important enough for putting to putting nuclear weapons out there so Patrick imagine we're sitting again here in four weeks do you think this map will change will there be more blue here for Ukraine will there be less what's your what's your prediction if I if I might ask um the shape will probably be different if you if you look at the Blue Zone and you see the river to the West um currently the ukrainians um damage quite a few bridges over the s River yeah and if you damage those bridges the Russian forces are trapped between the river and the and the Russia Ukraine Border in that area so that makes it easier defendable for the ukrainians and if they want to hold on to the terrain and have it as a bargaining chip in future negotiations um that will probably very be a very interesting part of Russia to to keep hold of because it's easier defendable behind the river um it's not extending your own logistical lines all to to brick um if if you go back to the east a little you see that the extension of the incursion is up to 35 kilometers to the north that means you have a very long supp TR on your sides you have to defend it but also internally you have very long logistical lines and you have to maintain uh um the Fighting Force by keeping ammunitions by keeping um fuel by keeping food by keeping men at a high level so that ask a lot of the whole logistical system so two two things you want to keep yourself safe you don't want to lose too much Mana material um and so you have to defend yourself and if you want to keep hold on that you find the best defendable position and probably that's between the border and the river super interesting super interesting um next question is before I go to the chat last last question before I go to questions from the chat so the EU right what does this mean because we are an EU Channel what what does this mean for the EU because at last in last year there has been skepticism for more and more parties across the EU around sending money military aid things like that to Ukraine do you think this incursion at this point in time I know things can change will improve that or will'll do the opposite where the you know the opposing parties get even stronger because now all of a sudden we're attacking Ukraine uh Russia sorry Russia yeah yeah no I think um everybody can see now that the dynamic has changed Ukraine is not only the party gradually losing and losing more terrain and do losing the war but Ukraine shows first of all that they with the right weapons with the right with enough money with enough men they can really change the outcome of the war at least the first signals are probably there um but also that means that every support they they prove actually that every support from from the EU and from Western Partners is very helpful in maintaining uh Ukraine's position and maintaining Ukraine as a free and hopefully Democratic country um which would fit into the European Union and and being part of the European Union would enhance the security of Ukraine as well so I think um this demonstration that also the red lines of Putin are still further up north um so we can do what we have to do in order to support Ukraine um and might embolden again the support which is there for Ukraine okay then let me thanks for the answer let me quickly go to the chat so firstly thank you black hole and thank you super Tera for your support appreciate your uh your super comments um and they're Thanking us for an awesome guest so Patrick there's a little compliment for you too and we have a question from imra um can you explain Patrick what is happening in the air above Ukraine why don't we see two Air Forces Clash are the S systems to so powerful on both sides and why are the f-16s and oh sorry and where are the f-16s and Su 57s this guy's knowledgeable I hope you understand the question well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um what we've seen over over the whole War actually is that there is no favorable air situation for the side and that's why Russia used the tactic of um of the dive bombs or the or the Glide bombs as we call them you can throw them from the aircraft 40 to 7 kilometers behind the front so on your own terrain uh above your own country and then they will glide into the opponent's country so 50 kilometers within Russia you release the bomb from very high altitude and it will fly UH 60 to 70 kilomet and um will EXP explode on the Ukrainian um area front troops hospitals whatever um so that's because both parties maintain a favorable air situation over their own terrain that means you it's very dangerous to fly with your fets over the opponent's terrain we see now especially in targeting the bridges we just talked about that it looks like they were attacked by aircraft by Ukrainian aircraft oh wait okay and that means that Ukraine brought their own air defense systems with them during this inclusion in order to keep the Russian Air Force at a distance um so they created a temporarily and locally air superiority in the area they're operating and then you can operate with your own aircraft there oh wow okay the suco 57 is still very limited in numbers it's questionable if it's really an effective aircraft um Russians boast about it but we haven't seen in action and because it's it's very rare the Russians don't risk to put it into operations the f-16s on the Ukrainian side I don't think many Ukrainian Pilots are already trained for the F-16 um there are not many f-16s and first of all I think the f-16s will be used in a air defense role pluging the gaps in the static air defense systems in the in the the groundbased air defense systems within Ukraine thems itself in order to shoot down uh cruise missiles and drones which are bypassing the um the groundbased air defense systems ukrainians have a lot to learn in the F16 um have to learn how to support ground troops have to learn how to do aerial combat and I think over time when they're better equipped when they're better trained more familiar with the F-16 and the Russian as situation the air defense situation is degreased degraded further then we can see the f-16s more in an offensive role but not at the moment interesting thank you for the question it's quite technical I hope understands I it is technical I think so I think so you're getting um getting lots of new questions but um let us know if that answered your question in the chat I will go to another point because I know you're a um well one of your Specialties is drone Warfare too so maybe we start there um drone War Warfare in Ukraine and and Russia of has there been an evolution in drone Warfare I mean we haven't seen that in the past have we or what's your opinion on that drones are already very old um but but they were only in a reconnaissance role until shortly in the fall of 2020 um there was a a five-week war in N kabak the azanis for the Armenians over a lot of territory in n kabak and there we could see the first use of drones integrated in the traditional armed forces and I think that was the um the Turning Point really there was a well an evolution as you in rightly say about the use of drones and now it's more or less exploded nobody can do without drones anymore um and because it's a new system we still struggling how to defend against drones both sides are um the costs for defense uh are 10 times higher than the means themselves if you want to down a drone a shahad drone um and you use a rocket system for that the rocket system is at least five or six times as expensive as shahad drones and those shahad drones they come in the thousands I think um colel General siski from the Ukrainian um general staff he reported yesterday that were almost 13 14,000 shahad drones fired at r at Ukraine by Russia um we have to look at new weapons to defend against drones better Radars better command and control better um warnings um um cheaper weapons like high energy lasers like electronic um electromagnetic pulse weapons in order to counter drones and if we see that the counter measures are becoming cheaper than the drones themselves then we've got a new situation but we are not there yet okay and so drones are being used as a throwaway item actually as a throwaway weapon and probably Ukraine is now the biggest drone producer in the world didn't know that that's yeah but makes sense right because they they're they're in full military yeah and and and if you have a drone which can do a lot of tasks which would normally be done by people by soldiers you would be stupid in order to deploy the soldier to do that task and um expose him to danger if you can have a drone to do that it was I always say it's it's unethical to send a soldier to do something for which you can use an unman system yeah because you have to spare your lives and as Ukraine the country itself is 15 times the size of the Netherlands has 44 million inhabitants whilst Russia is 11 time zones big and has 140 million inhabitants you know the scale the dimensions of the the Manpower are so different um and so diverent from each other that Ukraine has to spare every and every man and woman they have in order to make sure they can maintain themselves against the Russian aggression yeah we got some more questions um there's quite a few in the chat there was an interesting one I thought um which is will there ever be peace and that also leads to another question which is can uh here from yeah can even this current power in the Kremlin ever give up unless overthrown so I think I think yeah I think you can work with that can there ever be peace well let's hope so I would say and but it should be a just piece and what is a just piece it's a piece where both parties um have their right and and and um are happy with more or less and and they both have to give in but they they when both parties say okay this is the best we can reach at the moment but at the moment well with the successful Russ uh Ukrainian incursion in Russia president Selinsky thinks I still got a lot to win um and President Putin thinks I can win because I've got the stamina to maintain this battle for a long time I've got bigger stamina than the West which supports Ukraine so as long as these very Divergent views on uh the future of this War uh are still present there won't be a peace there won't even be talks about peace well Ukraine is in the process of organizing a peace um uh conference in the end of this year but it's questionable if Russia will join they are invited but will they join if they don't join well it will never be a success of course and Putin states that okay we can have a peace if you give the four provinces luhans donet saparia and uh who um car on to me you decrease your Armed Forces tremendously and you promise never to be a member of NATO um but that's that's not realistic that's not realistic because that would mean that Ukraine will be falling into the hands of of Russia will not be defendable anymore will not be viable as a state anymore and don't forget from those four preferences those four oblasts um neither one is complet completely in the hands of Putin um especially Zaria and Kon blast are only partly uh um uh uh in the hands of Putin so these these demands are unrealistic and now that the KK Invasion has taken place um even the the Kremlin representative in the United Nations stated that well the very generous offer we gave to Ukraine um the points are just mentioned is now off the table and that means well it's only diverging further and further so will there be peace We should strive for peace but it should be a just peace um but not in the near future I'm afraid but the really really you know to push you a little bit on this do you think it's possible with Putin do you think it's possible with a leader like that in the Kremlin or does it does it does something need to happen before we can even think about peace Making Peace yeah that's that's the full on question you asked um probably we need such a shock in order in the system in order to have someone else there who can say okay enough of this madness and we have to come to to to our censes with Ukraine and see what we can hold on to um in order to maintain a stable situation but Ukraine will always ask for security and defense guarantees and they don't trust Russia anymore and that's logical because in 1991 1994 their borders were established they were established as a sovereign country and Russia again and again invaded um invaded Ukraine first of all 2014 by taking Crimea and now in 2022 but also in 2040 by helping the um opposing forces Ines luhansk so there is absolutely no trust on the Ukrainian side in in Putin and his whole siloviki environment so that must change quite a lot on in the Kremlin before ziny will um will will support a peace deal and uh which will deliver probably some parts of Ukraine as it is at the moment that's yeah I I I did I expected an answer like that which which makes sense let me go to the chat again um there's a lot of questions so thank you for the super chats we'll prioritize those so if you want your question answered that's the best way to do it super Tera thank you um so here's a question on the PS actually how big is the scale of Russian PS captured by Ukraine they are more politically important because they are conscripts and there are many do you have a estimate there or do you do you know anything about this yeah um the last numbers I read were about 2,000 soldiers and indeed the especially the conscripts these are a pain in the neck for Putin because conscripts um and that's within the German uh in in the Russian um uh Constitution uh are not allowed to to enter a war and therefore we don't see conscripts in in The Wider Ukraine theater um only if they sign contracts which will which happens often and they are being uh pushed to sign contracts um but conscripts as conscripts are not allowed to take part in a war now they are in a war because Ukraine invaded right part of Russia where conscripts did actually were there to guard the Border because Russia never thought that Ukraine would cross the border um and there's a very strong movement within Russia the mother of conscripts organization or something like that and they are powerful and they already um have raised their voices that how is it possible that Russia doesn't protect those boys in service of the motherland um and let them fall into the hands of ukrainians what we see and I think it's not only propaganda but there's a lot of truism in that is that Ukraine is managing the the PWS uh and taking care of the PWS according to the Geneva conventions while on the Russian side well we saw Russian um uh Ukrainian con Ukrainian PWS coming back from Russian captivity they were they lost a lot of uh body mass like like up to 40 to 60 kilogram sometimes and they were Mal nurtured they were maltreated they were um uh subject to um um Maringa what what's that in English Maringa yeah that's a torture torture torture they were subject to torture yeah um and even Russia tortures their own soldiers who who don't want to fight and They Se videos it's crazy um so uh I think those conscripts are probably better off being in Ukrainian PW camps than within um the Russian uh Barracks yeah yeah sadly it's it's really sad seeing uh I mean what's going on for human lives over there at the border it's it's absolutely insane it's always the humans who suffer the the the civilians but also the soldiers being sent there with the wrong motives right and that's what we saw from the start of the the whole war in in February 202 to when the Russian soldiers really thought that within three days they would be in Kiev and they would be welcomed with bread and salt which is the Ukrainian way to say welcome to De guest but it turned out the other way completely I mean that's one of the most surprising things at the War I mean me as a non-military expert I thought when it started it's days until Kia Falls because it's it's Russia you know we always imagine it when we grew up anyway when I grew up as a massive power oh absolutely um I think most analyst uh that I mean myself also um the Russian bear is loose and is Unstoppable but um the Russian army is the second strongest in Ukraine at the moment right it's a big statement yeah um Patrick here is also a a a good question and thank you Villa and thank you for being a patreon um so he's asking how effective the EU and let's focus on the EU um how effective the EU has been in supporting Ukraine and have they done enough oh that's that's a good question according to seninsky um they're not doing enough in the right time um things should be done in a quicker way but that's how the EU Works everybody knows that it's the 27 they have to agree unanimously and within those um member states well some member states are less um concerned about the Ukraine fate like Hungary and SLO Slovakian Republic at the moment um what's happening now with the uh confiscated Russian uh money uh within the EU and the revenues from that money which will go to Ukraine I think that's a very important step right um it's 1.5 billion so far I think right in Euros I mean that will have to increase but yeah yeah yeah yeah probably rising up to five billion a year or something like that right yeah which is an important help um but the problem is that within the European Union a lot of the member states have um gone through tremendous um decreases of their military systems and the military apparatus and the military capability over the past 30 years after the Iron Curtain ended and the cold war ended and that means that we have little stuff really to give Ukraine and we have no industrial Capac to beef up quickly in order to give Ukraine the right weapons in the right time and um that's not so much that the you EU doesn't want but that's more that the EU isn't capable and also the promise of cherry Bron the EU commissioner that right by the end of this year that would be a million 155 millim grenades for the artillery systems that Ukraine has uh got donated by by the West um we don't get we don't meet that Target because there's no industrial cap capability in order to be up so quickly and that's just one weapon system it's also about air defense system it's about um uh armored cars it's about tanks there's just too little left in the inventory of the European armies uh after 30 years of Peace dividend as we call it in the Netherlands uh decreasing the Armed Forces because we would never fight a war like this again in the European uh continent um but how different did it become yeah there's another Topic at I'm moving moving topics now quickly to something else which was very interesting and made and made the news and that was let me just quickly share this link so we can change here we go oh no here we go here we go oh this this also made the news recently and I thought it' be interesting to discuss with you too and that is the nordstream pipeline explosion so for everyone here I mean again if you've been living under a rock um two years ago in 20 22 the pipelines the northstream pipelines um have been well there was explosions there on the on the pipelines and they were partially destroyed and it's been a big question mark who did this right there's been speculation it was the US it was even Russia Ukraine no one knew loads of different players in this and now there's this news that a Ukrainian man apparently at least that's what the allegation is um did this do you Patrick what what is your opinion on this do you see this as a valid um valid case or not well first of all um all the news concerning this Pipeline and what was again in the W Street Journal this week or last week last week it was um was just um reused again um revived again because there's nothing new there there's no new evidence the only new thing is that the German judicial system now wants this probably Ukrainian man being uh handed over to Germany in order to put him through uh the system there but there's nothing new there and actually if you think about it the evidence um that um that it was the Andromeda sailing yard with six people on board who planted three bombs within um the very cold and rough sorry to interrupt Patrick can you maybe explain that I'm not sure the audience knows that like what happened like what's the allegation well um there was a um um research done by I think it was the Germans and they stated that six Ukrainian people five guys and one woman they rented in the harbor of Roso in former Eastern Germany and the Baltic Sea Baltic Sea Harbor a sailing yard Andromeda is very small yard and they used it um they sail to to Born home the Danish Island close to where the the nor St M and two pipelines are on the bottom of the um Baltic Sea and they also sail to sandam which is in Sweden and is sailed back to Born home and allegedly there was um traces of explosives found on that boat afterwards and um they more or less traced um the rental of the boat back to ukrainians and so they said ukrainians have planted the bombs of nordstream Pipelines and they were behind it but if you really do a good research first of all um from such a small yard and also that was later done and repeated by the i in Germany the AL Miner hun deut um there were people there who were trained say uh divers and they said I this is not a ship I would dive off anyway especially not 70 or 80 Metter deep which is how deep the Baltic Sea is you need read special equipment you need a lot of oxygen tanks you need a decompression chamber you need um nitrogen uh in order to dive and that just doesn't fit on the boat a dive to 70 Metter can only done be done once a day by a very experienced diver um at the time the seed was very cold as well especially on 70 meters so you you actually you have to dive in a dry suit um and in order to plant the explosives you really have a um a crane aboard in order to let these explosives about 50 to 60 kilogram down you can't take that down as a diver because it will pull you so fast down 50 kilos extra it will just um ruin you as a as human being so actually practically it's it's almost impossible to to to do that from that little ship and also the woman I talked about she is currently in Russia allegedly and hasn't been arrested if she was involved in um in this in this nordstream affair she would already be in prison and in Russia because you can go in prison for Russia for almost nothing at the moment so it's it's probably it's it's still bad research which has being done but it's being um how do you call that it's being reused again uh revived again um and that's very bad for Ukraine that's very bad for the mutual support for Ukraine nobody really dives into the possibility is it really feasible from this little very little yard in bad weather conditions diving so deep in a very cold and rough sea with very heavy equipment done be done right right right right I mean my next question would be is this going to hurt Ukraine support a story like this or is it not really strong enough well the the damage is already being done a lot of people just take this story and say okay we have to stop the help to to Ukraine um we see that in Germany the half day um alternative if you deand which is a very right-wing party is against support for Ukraine and there are local elections um next month I I know in Eastern Germany and probably the afd will win um so if this movement becomes bigger and bigger um it might put a bomb under the support to Ukraine also you know the discussions in the German um uh government about um the bottom of the um uh Government funding is is is there and only current and um signed up uh financial help for Ukraine will continue and not new help and also in the Netherlands um with the rightwing party there were questions asked from should we still uh prolong our help to Ukraine now that this is happening well nothing new is happening let me be clear on that um it's regenerated old news in order to help the Russians and the more this is being talked about um the more Putin will laugh yeah yeah no okay so let's let's not talk about it anymore we'll go um we have a couple minutes left so everyone in the chat ask your last questions if you have any um also some more questions are off topic so we have one question off topic Patrick that we that BGC Von asked thank you very much and and he asked do the Dutch have a prefix like HMS for your ships do we do you know yes um uh zms Z mayates his majesty uh yeah we do yeah okay interesting okay I didn't even know that I'm from the Netherlands too but I had no idea that we did no every Kingdom I guess has that for its Naval vessels yeah yeah another question I'm just going to go for some cheat questions what is here vilder to St on all this do we um on on Ukraine and everything because I think that's expanding what you were explaining earlier yeah um officially party pay which is a party without members because is the only member and you might ask questions about the Democratic value of this party but that's not an issue formerly he's part of the government and um in the government um policy long during support for Ukraine is being written down but we all know K wers he's always probing and uh trying to get his way and he asked very critical questions of course everybody's allowed to do that but we all know what's behind those critical questions um but formerly his party is supporting Ukraine and um let's keep it at that yeah yeah then another question around your specialty uh Patrick um you talked about um specialty in space domain and drone Warfare we talked a little bit about that already and maybe to specify y like Mann drones still they still have an operator working behind a man drone for example but is there is there development with AI driven drones or basically what is the future in that in that whole area Okay um a man drone is very confusing because drones are always unman systems right that doesn't mean there's no man in the loop there's always still always a man in the loop for drone systems um the Netherlands uses for example um we say that The Reaper mq9 drone which is a very big drone and can carry weapons as well but it's you being used for reconnaissance is a is an aircraft where the pilot isn't in the aircraft but sitting in a container and in in another location so um within our government policy um drones are uh still managed by people there still there's always a man in the loop but of course there's this tendency to use artificial intelligence drones can be um can be tampered with in the electronic warfare domain um Disturbed their the the communication between the pilot and the ground and the system itself in the air can be disturbed by electronic electromagnetic waves um but if you still want your drone to do um what is being programmed to do you have to put in artificial intelligence to make sure that the Drone can make decisions on its own in order to fulfill its task which has been set by the operator on the ground um but also in other fields for example in in air defense where we might use might have to use artificial intelligence if you're overwhelmed by a lot of by a swarm of drones which is also um artificial intelligence um commandeered um probably you also need artificial intelligence to make make the best decisions in which is the biggest threat which weapon should I use against the threat and how can I um keep myself as safe as possible so it's a trend which absolutely will increase the use of artificial intelligence but we still have um the moral and ethical value that when you have a drone which you can use in order to kill people there must always be a man in the loop yeah yeah make makes makes sense too um I know where on the dot right Patrick I know you have your evening to enjoy maybe before before we end maybe quickly show everyone again that's on the call your your book that you contributed a couple chapters to so like I said earlier Reflections on the Russian Ukraine war um check it out if you're interested everyone here um and you wrote Patrick two chapters was it or three chapters no one one chapter together with Professor Dr lonica paper comp and that's only about the use of the space domain in the ukra train War uh what did we see how is it being used um and also how civil um uh commercial partners are being are becoming part of the war in in especially in the space domain in the first day of the war everybody still remembers those images of this 60 kilometers uh traffic jam going from from Russia into Ukraine close to Kiev and those images weren't made by military satellites they were made by Planet lab and maxar and these are um commercial firms and also starlink um by Elon Musk SpaceX company uh the Starling satellite communication system was essential for Ukraine in order to maintain their command control um their um overview and and command from the Central Command in KF to all the units and Starling was really essential at that but also we know the stories that Starling was shut up when Ukraine wanted to attack the Crimea so here's you how you see how um commercial players can influence the war even though they're not part of the war or not part of the faing uh fighting uh factions right I mean h I know we just quit but very last comment on that actually the St starlink Elon Musk starlink for example I I find it interesting because elon's getting a lot of hate from the EU lately and there's a lot of you know problems which is fine but he's been vital to the war effort hasn't he or or how do you see that sorry he he's been vital to the war effort oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah um you're right and and that was very generous of him also but he he's also a very strange guy and um he threatened to cut off the whole Starling situation because he wasn't paid for it and um that means if if you want to do part uh if you want to partner up with commercial uh uh civilian firms and you in a war you really have to think about what are the the dangers I'm entering what are the risks how can I mitigate those risks yeah and we we enter a whole new field of um of warfare in in uh in this issue here yeah no I see that too I see it too it's a difficult situation the the def fight between the EU and Elon Musk was more about Twitter not so much on starlink yeah yeah no no definitely I just thought it's interesting we always um you know we always we bash Elon Musk a lot but then again you know you have to give credit where credit is due to I guess he he created dependability he's like a hardworks dealer yeah first first uh you become dependent on him and then you have to pay yeah yeah that's that's also a way of doing business yeah yeah Patrick um thank you I everyone the comments was very positive so um thank Patrick everyone it was great to have you on I really appreciate your time my pleasure and um
