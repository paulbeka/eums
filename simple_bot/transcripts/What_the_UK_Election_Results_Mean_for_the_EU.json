    "transcription": "The UK General Election results are in, and \nit is terrible news for the Conservatives,   who have now suffered one of the biggest losses in \ntheir history, after being in power for 14 years,   since Gordon Brown in 2010. The clear winner \nis the Labour Party. But before we look at   the results in more detail, let's first have a \nquick look at how the UK elections actually work. The UK uses a first-past-the-post \nsystem in general elections. Each   of the 650 constituencies elects one Member \nof Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. As an example, let’s look at the \nSuffolk Coastal constituency. Five   parties received a significant number of \nvotes, with labour obtaining a plurality   of 31.70%. Under the First Past the \nPost system, Labour won the seat in   the House of Commons because they secured \nthe most votes among the competing parties. The party with the majority of seats \ntypically forms the government. To   achieve an outright majority, a party \nneeds to secure at least 326 seats. The leader of the party that wins the \nmajority of seats in the House of Commons   becomes the Prime Minister. If no party wins \nan outright majority, a hung parliament occurs,   and parties may seek to form coalitions \nor agreements to establish a government.   The incumbent Prime Minister remains in \noffice until a new government is formed. And let’s not forget about the King! \nKing Charles III has a role too,   though it's mostly ceremonial. After \na general election, the King invites   the leader of the majority party to form a \ngovernment and become the Prime Minister. So, what do the first round \nresults look like? Let's   first look at the percentages, and then the seats. In sixth place is the centre-left Scottish \nNational Party (SNP), led by John Swinney,   with 2.4% of the vote. They \nstand for Scottish independence,   the protection of public services like the \nNHS, and a fair progressive tax system. The SNP is very pro-European Union and advocates \nfor increased cooperation across Europe to enhance   Scotland's economic and social well-being. \nThey aim to reverse the damage of Brexit,   re-enter the single market, restore free movement \nfor EU citizens, and ultimately rejoin the EU. In fifth place are the left-wing Greens, led \nby Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, with 6.8%   of the vote. They stand for environmental \nissues, social justice, and sustainability. The Greens are pro-European Union and \nwant more cooperation across Europe to   tackle climate change and promote sustainable \ndevelopment. Their manifesto lacks detail,   but interestingly, the one time \nthe manifesto mentions the EU,   they write, and I quote, “rejoin \nthe EU as soon as it is right”. In fourth place are the centre \nto centre-left Liberal Democrats,   led by Ed Davey, with 12.2% of the vote. \nThey want to improve public services,   fight climate change and reform \nthe UK’s electoral system. The Liberal Democrats are pro-European Union. \nThey have consistently campaigned for closer   ties with the EU and have previously advocated \nfor a second referendum to reverse Brexit. The LibDem Manifesto wants closer cooperation \nwith the EU in many areas like Climate Change,   Defense and farming. They also want to join \nthe Single Market, which is an essential step   on the road to EU membership, which \nremains their longer-term objective. Since the UK election results were announced, \ndepending on where you get your information,   you could have a very different spin on what \npeople are thinking about these results. This is where Ground News, today’s video sponsor,   shines. Ground News is a news app and website \nthat gathers related articles globally,   showing political leanings, reliability, \nand ownership data for each source. If we look at this story we can easily see \nthat this story has been covered by over   40 different sources and it is covered by more \nleft leaning sources than right leaning sources. My favourite feature is seeing different news \nsources, such as the Euractiv known for its   left leaning stance, reporting the story quite \npositively for labour, focusing on their win.   In contrast, the right-leaning headlines \nfrom The Sun focus on Reform UK and their   monumental breakthrough rather than labour - \nwhich is a different spin on the same story. What I really like about Ground News \nis how it promotes balanced news,   which is so important in today’s polvarised world. \nMy channel also tries to address this issue,   and Ground News helps so much in my \nmission to address bias in the media.\n   Subscribe to Ground News at ground.news/EUMS. \nUse my link in the description or scan this   QR code to save 40% on the Vantage plan for \nunlimited access to all the features that I use. In third place is the right-wing populist Reform \nUK party, led by Nigel Farage. Yes, he is back,   with 14.3% of the vote. Reform UK advocates for a \nsmaller government, lower taxes, and significant   political reform. They also made the fight against \nimmigration a central part of their campaign. Reform UK is strongly anti-EU. \nOriginally called the Brexit Party,   they called for a \"Hard\" Brexit, meaning \na bare minimum relationship with the EU. They advocate for complete sovereign \ncontrol over immigration, trade,   and regulatory matters. They oppose any form of \nrejoining the EU or its economic structures like   the Customs Union or Single Market. They also want \nto leave the European Convention on Human Rights. In second place are the centre-right \nto right-wing Conservatives,   led by Rishi Sunak, with 23.7% of the vote. The Conservative Party emphasises free-market \npolicies, reducing government intervention,   and maintaining strong national security. When it comes to the EU, the Conservatives \nled the UK through the Brexit process and   supported a sovereign UK independent of \nthe EU. Their manifesto provides little   detail on the desired relationship \nwith the EU, but one thing is clear:   they strongly oppose rejoining the \nEU or any of its economic structures. The party emphasises UK sovereignty \nand regulatory independence,   frequently mentioning the removal \nof legacy EU regulations. The   Conservatives are also committed to \nnegotiating trade deals independently. In first place is the centre-left \nLabour Party, led by Keir Starmer,   with 33.9% of the vote. Let's not mince our \nwords, the Labour party won by a landslide. The Labour Party wants to focus on \nimproving healthcare, education,   and welfare, with policies aimed at reducing \ninequality and supporting the working class. Labour advocates for a closer relationship \nwith the EU, stating that “they want to reset   the relationship and seek to deepen ties with \nour European friends, neighbours and allies”. Labour aims to improve the UK’s trade \nand investment relationship with the   EU by removing unnecessary trade barriers.\nThey seek to prevent unnecessary border checks,   reduce food costs, and secure \na mutual recognition agreement   for professional qualifications \nto benefit UK service exporters.  Additionally, they advocate for a new UK-EU \nsecurity pact to enhance global cooperation. But while Labour wants to improve relations, \ntheir manifesto clearly states that “There will   be no return to the single market, the \ncustoms union, or freedom of movement.”   And when it comes to rejoining the EU, Keir \nStarmer made it very clear a couple days ago,   where he said: “The UK will not rejoin the \nEU or the EU Single Market in his lifetime”. So how many seats did each of \nthese parties actually win? As of the time of recording: Labour got 412 seats\nConservatives: 120 seats  Reform UK: 4 seats\nLiberal Democrats: 71 seats  Greens: 4 seats\nAnd the SNP: 9 seats Yes this seems a bit odd doesn’t it? \nLabour won a massive majority of seats,   63 percent of the total seats in fact. But \nwon only 34 percent of the total vote? Even   more peculiar is that Reform UK received \nmore votes than the Liberal Democrats,   but only got 4 seats compared \nto the LibDems 71 seats. This is due to the UK's First Past the Post \nsystem, where the winner of the constituency   takes all, even if the second, third and fourth \nplaced parties receive tens of thousands of votes. For example, if Reform UK were to come \nsecond in every single constituency,   they would be the second largest party \nin the UK but would have 0 seats. This is different in a proportional \nrepresentation system like in the   Netherlands, and I am sure this will be \nmany discussions in the coming weeks,   as to whether the First Past the Post System \nis fair and reflective of the populace. Nonetheless, Labour's victory is the biggest \nvictory a single party has achieved since   1997. With 412 seats this is way over the 326 \nneeded to form a majority. If we compare the   results to the previous election in 2019, \nyou can see that the biggest winners are   Labour and the Lib Dems and the biggest \nlosers are the conservatives and the SNP. So, what does all of this mean? Firstly, Keir Starmer will become the \nnew Prime Minister and with such a   significant majority he can push through \na lot of his plans in his manifesto. This result is also good news for the EU,   as Starmer advocates for \ncloser cooperation with Europe. However, the UK will not join the Customs Union,   Single Market or the EU anytime soon. \nAs you can see in this overview,   the vast majority of seats went to parties that \nwant more EU cooperation but no EU membership.
