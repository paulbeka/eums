Polls had   predicted a razor-thin 3% margin between the \ntop three parties, making this one of the   most closely contested races in recent history.\nThe main contenders were the center-right Fine   Gael (Fee-na g-ale), a key player in the outgoing \ngovernment led by Prime Minister Simon Harris;   the centrist Fianna Fáil (fee-in-a fall), a ruling \ncoalition partner in the outgoing administration;   and the left-wing Sinn Féin (shin \nfane ), the largest opposition force.  In terms of the EU—and since we’re an EU-focused \nchannel—it’s worth noting that all three parties   are generally pro-Europe, though to varying \ndegrees. Both Fine Gael (Fee-na g-ale),, part of   the EPP, and Fianna Fáil(fee-in-a fall), aligned \nwith Renew Europe, are pro-European but support   Ireland's neutrality in defense. Sinn Féin (shin \nfane ), part of the Left in the EU parliament,   is not necessarily anti-EU, but is definitely \nmore critical of the EU’s current structures,   calling for reforms and rejecting any \nmilitary integration or cooperation.  So, now that you know the key players, let’s \nrewind the clock to the start of this year to   understand what led us to this moment. Back \nin January, the left-wing Sinn Féin(shin   fane ) was riding high in the polls \nat 29%, dominating its opposition and   capturing significant public support.\nBut fast forward to November the 6th,   and their popularity has taken a sharp \nnosedive to 3rd place at 18%, largely   due to their unclear position on migration and a \nseries of damaging scandals. These controversies   include allegations of misconduct, internal \nmismanagement, and cover-ups. For example:  A former Sinn Fein (shin fane )press \nofficer admitted to child sex offences,   with two party staff resigning after providing him   unauthorized references. (Michael McMonagle)\nTwo Sin Fein Members of Parliament also   resigned—one over claims of censorship and \nanother following a controversial internal   investigation into a sexual harassment \ncomplaint. (Patricia Ryan, Brian Stanley)  Additionally, a former senator stepped down \nafter admitting to sending inappropriate text   messages to a teenager. (Niall Ó Donnghaile)\nThese issues have raised serious concerns about   Sinn Féin's (shin fane )leadership and integrity. \nInstead of focusing on Ireland’s future, the party   has been stuck in damage control, putting extra \npressure on Mary Lou McDonald at a critical time.  Naturally, the opposition seized the moment. Prime \nMinister called a snap election for November the   29th, rather than waiting for the March deadline, \nhoping to capitalize on two key factors:  a feel-good October budget that delivered €2.2 \nbillion in bonus cash just in time for Christmas,  and Sinn Féin’s (shin fane )stunning collapse.\nThis bold move was part of Harris’s bid to   extend Fine Gael’s (Fee-na g-ale), \nrecord 14-year hold on power.  Ireland has now gone to the polls, and the \ncountry employs a unique voting system.   There are 43 constituencies, where voters elect \nmultiple lawmakers into the 174 seat parliament.   Voters rank candidates in their constituency in \norder of preference—1 for their first choice,   2 for their second, and so on. This system, \nknown as Proportional Representation with a   Single Transferable Vote (PR-STV), allows for a \nmore accurate reflection of voter preferences.   Explaining it in detail would require a whole \nvideo, so let us know if you're interested!  Now, who has actually won?\nIrish elections might not make   headlines in my home country, but I stay in the \nloop with some excellent daily newsletters. The   downside? My inbox is drowning in spam! I’ve \ntried unsubscribing and blocking senders,   but it feels like an endless battle.\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Behind   the scenes, countless databases hold your personal \ninformation—your name, home address, phone number,   and more. In the wrong hands, it could end up \nbeing sold or, worse, exploited by criminals.  This is exactly what happened to me when \nI got a fake DHL email asking for money   to receive a package—and I almost fell \nfor it! And it is not just about SPAM,   your data is out there for anyone to misuse.\nThis is where today’s sponsor, Incogni,   really shines. Incogni contacts these data brokers \nfor you, requests the removal of your personal   information, and even handles any objections that \ncome up.

It really is a small price to \npay to protect yourself and avoid getting scammed!  So without any further ado, \nlet's look the election results:  In third place is Fine Gael (Fee-na g-ale), \nwith 20.8% of the vote, resulting in 38 seats.  In third place, we have the \nSinn Féin (shin fane )party,   securing 19% of the vote and earning 39 seats.\nAnd finally, the winner of the Irish elections   is the Fianna Fáil (fee-in-a fall) party, \nwith 21.9% of the vote, claiming 48 seats.  This outcome likely marks the end of \nSimon Harris's tenure as Prime Minister.  His gamble of calling an early election to \noutmaneuver Sinn Féin (shin fane) backfired,   with Sinn Féin gaining an additional \nseat. However, the real surprise came   from Harris's coalition partner, Fianna Fáil \n(fee-in-a fall), which surged ahead to claim   the top spot by a significant margin. This \nstunning turn of events is a major triumph   for Fianna Fáil and positions Micheál Martin \nto become the new Prime Minister of Ireland.  But we're not done yet with the rankings! In an \nimpressive fourth place are the independents.  Ireland’s proportional representation system \nfacilitates a more diverse parliamentary makeup,   allowing smaller parties and independent \ncandidates with strong local support to secure   seats. This independent group represents a wide \narray of political perspectives—from far-left to   far-right, and from pro-EU to anti-EU activists.\nTied in fifth were the Social Democrats and the   Centre-Left Labour Part.\nIn seventh,came the   right-wing Independent Ireland.\nIn eighth, the far-left People   Before Profit-Solidarity,tIn ninth, \nthe socially conservative yet fiscally   center-left Aontú (pronounced \"On Too\"),\nAnd in a very disappointing tenth,   the Centre-Left Greens\nNow going back to the 5 biggest parties,   let’s also take another quick look at how \nthese parties align with EU political groups   and their stance on the EU. Notably, none of \nthe top five parties are strongly Eurosceptic.  Ireland presents a unique landscape compared to \nmany European countries, as it lacks a significant   top 5 far-right party. However, far-right voices \non social media have been working to drum up   hostility toward migrants. You see, Ireland \nhas an acute housing shortage, which was one   of the major topics to dominate the election. And \nTangled up with the housing issue is immigration,   a fairly recent challenge to a country long \ndefined by emigration. Recent arrivals include   more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war \nand thousands of people fleeing poverty and   conflict in the Middle East and Africa.\nInterestingly, this issue seems to have   impacted Sinn Féin(shin fane ), as some \nworking-class supporters were not happy   with the party’s pro-immigration policies.\nAnother topic that has gained significant   traction over the past decade is the prospect of \nIreland’s reunification with Northern Ireland,   which is currently part of the UK.\nWhile Fine Gael (Fee-na g-ale),and   Fianna Fáil (fee-in-a fall) acknowledge the \npossibility of reunification in the far future,   they do not actively pursue it. Sinn Féin (shin \nfane ), however, is the party most strongly in   favor of reunification and wants a referendum \nby 2030. Notably, Sinn Féin (shin fane )also   has a Northern Ireland branch and they are \ncurrently the biggest party in local government,   the Stormont assembly and Westminster.\nFor advocates of reunification,   this election result may come as a disappointment. \nSinn Féin (shin fane )in power on both sides of   the border would have added substantial pressure \non the UK to permit a reunification referendum,   a crucial step toward advancing the cause.\nNonetheless, with no party securing 50% of   the votes, coalition-building will be \nessential. The most likely outcome is   another Fianna Fáil (fee-in-a fall)-Fine \nGael (Fee-na g-ale),coalition. However,   even this partnership falls just short \nof the 88 seats needed for a majority,   meaning a third partner will be required.\nThe Labour Party emerges as the most likely   candidate, as a recent opinion poll shows it \nas the public’s preferred choice for a junior   coalition partner, with 21% support.\nIf Labour declines to join,   several alternative options remain:\nThey could team up with 2 or more independents,   though this would require careful negotiation \ngiven the ideological diversity within the group.  Or the Social Democrats: and while \npossible, this option is less likely   as they are being positioned further to the \nleft than Fianna Fáil (fee-in-a fall) and   Fine Gael(Fee-na g-ale), typically prefer.\nThen there is Aontú or Independent Ireland:   But their right-wing stances \nmake this partnership unlikely.  Interestingly, the outgoing coalition \npartner, the Greens, are entirely out   of contention after securing just one seat—a \ndramatic fall from their previous standing.  But what do you think?
