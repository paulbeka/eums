Now,   you might be thinking, “Why should I care \nabout some local elections in Germany?”  Well, Chancellor Scholz and the ruling coalition \nhave been struggling, and these results could   either provide a lifeline or bring national \nelections forward. In this case, it was the   former! These results bring some much-needed \ngood news for Scholz, as his party, the   SPD—which has dominated Brandenburg since German \nreunification in 1991—just managed to hold on.  Before we dive into the numbers, let’s take a \nquick look at how German politics actually work. Germany’s political system runs on federalism. \nAt its core, federalism means that power is   divided between the national government (the \nfederal level) and the 16 individual states,   known as Länder. Each of these Länder \nhas its own parliament and government,   giving them significant autonomy to \nmake decisions on various issues. The federal government also has a \nparliament, called the Bundestag,   and handles nationwide responsibilities like \nforeign policy, defence, immigration laws,   and taxes. Meanwhile, the Länder have control \nover education, policing, cultural affairs,   and healthcare, allowing them to tailor these \nareas to the specific needs of their populations. This balance of power allows \nGermany to maintain national   unity while respecting regional diversity. So, in regional elections like Brandenburg’s, \nvoters choose representatives for their state   parliament—the Landtag. And here’s where \nit gets fun: German voters get two votes! Let’s break it down using Sunday’s \nelections in Brandenburg. The state   is divided into 44 electoral districts. \nWe’ll focus on Spree-Neiße 2, district 42. For the first vote, voters choose \na direct candidate from their local   area. The candidate with the most \nvotes wins a seat in the Landtag,   securing a direct mandate. In Spree-Neiße 2, that \nseat went to Michael Hanko from the AfD party. Now, if we look at Brandenburg as a whole, \n44 seats in the Landtag are filled by these   direct mandate winners from each district's first \nvote, with the AfD winning most direct mandates. For the second vote, Voters pick a party, not a \nspecific person. This vote determines the overall   composition of the state parliament. The more \nvotes a party gets, the more seats they earn. Now,   looking at Brandenburg as a whole, most \npeople used their second vote for the SPD,   followed by the AfD and then \nBSW. To ensure proportionality,   additional seats are added to the parliament \nso that the overall representation matches the   proportion of votes each party received \nin the second vote. For example, the SPD   received 13 additional seats to get as close as \npossible to the 30.9% of total 2nd votes won. This system balances direct representation with \nproportional representation, ensuring that both   the local favourites and overall party \npreferences are reflected in the Landtag.  Yes, it’s a bit over-engineered—but hey, \nwe’re talking about Germany here, right? —---------------\nSo, when you tally   up the results of the first and second votes, \nhere are the final numbers for Brandenburg:  In a surprising twist, the SPD came out \non top with 32 seats. The Centre-Left   party defied the polls from recent weeks and \nmonths that had the far-right AfD in the lead.  You can almost hear Chancellor Olaf Scholz, \nalso from the SPD, breathe a sigh of relief.   His approval ratings have been dismal—only \n32% of Germans are satisfied with the job he's   doing. This unexpected victory in Brandenburg \nprovides a much-needed boost for the party.  The real credit for this win, however, goes \nto Dietmar Woidke, the SPD’s lead candidate   and Brandenburg’s Minister-President since \n2013. Woidke remains popular in the state,   with 61% of voters expressing satisfaction \nwith his leadership over the past five years.  Interestingly, Woidke had announced he would \nstep down if the AfD emerged as the winner—an   all-or-nothing gamble that seems to have paid off.\nBut what it also comes down to is this:   according to exit polls, 75% of people who \nvoted for the SPD did so not out of conviction,   but to prevent the AfD from winning. This \nreveals the deep polarization in Brandenburg,   where fear of the far-right drove voters \nmore than faith in the SPD’s platform.  That brings us to second place, the far-right \nAfD, with 30 seats. The AfD is known for   advocating strict immigration policies, opposing \nsupport for Ukraine, and maintaining a generally   Eurosceptic stance. Their lead candidate \nin Brandenburg, Hans-Christoph Berndt,   joined the AfD in 2019 and has been classified \nas a right-wing extremist by the Brandenburg   Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\nIn third is the BSW (Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht),   grabbing 14 seats—impressive for a party \nthat didn’t exist a year ago. Led by Sahra   W agenknecht, a former Left Party politician, \nBSW combines left-wing economic policies with   more conservative views on immigration and is \nstaunchly against military support for Ukraine. In fourth place is the CDU with 12 seats. \nThe CDU is Germany’s center-right party,   home to figures like former Chancellor \nAngela Merkel and the current President   of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. \nAs the main opposition to the federal government,   this result is particularly disappointing for \nthe CDU. Just days ago, the party announced its   chancellor candidate, Friedrich Merz, to challenge \nOlaf Scholz, and a strong win in Brandenburg   would have been an ideal start for his campaign.\nSo, these are the top four parties that managed   to secure seats, while all others, including the \nGreens and the FDP—both members of the current   ruling coalition with the SPD—fell short of the \n5% threshold. This is a significant setback,   reflecting widespread dissatisfaction \nwith the coalition's performance.  The real challenge now is determining which \nparties will form a coalition, a task made   especially difficult by the fact that all parties \nhave ruled out collaborating with the AfD. To form a governing coalition in \nBrandenburg, 45 seats are needed.  One likely coalition could be between the SPD \nand BSW, as their socially-oriented policies may   have significant overlap. However, the BSW's \nmore controversial stances, particularly its   opposition to military support for Ukraine, could \ncreate tension and complicate their cooperation. \n   Then there's the option of an SPD-CDU coalition, \nas they've governed together with the Greens over   the past five years. However, since the \nGreens didn't secure any seats this time,   an SPD-CDU partnership would fall short—together, \nthey only have 44 seats, just one seat shy of   the majority needed to govern. This makes the \nfirst coalition the only real possibility. \n  Now that you’ve probably learned more about \nGerman state elections than you ever wanted to,   what does it all mean for Germany and the EU?\nIn the short term, not much will change.   But in the long term, the political \nlandscape could shift significantly.  Germany’s traditional parties are struggling \nin the East. Yes, the SPD technically won in   Brandenburg, but it wasn't a victory driven \nby enthusiasm for the party or Chancellor   Olaf Scholz. As exit polls showed, most voters \nsupported the SPD simply to block the far-right   AfD. And for the CDU, this election marked one of \ntheir worst results in eastern Germany in years.  And it’s not just Brandenburg. Recent elections \nin Saxony and Thuringia also saw the AfD gaining   ground, even winning the most seats in \nThueringen. The trend is becoming clear:   in the East, the AfD is rising, while the CDU \nand SPD are in steady decline—at least for now.  However, it's important to remember that eastern \nGermany is distinct from the rest of the country.   Nationally, the CDU is still projected to \nperform well, with the AfD in second place   and the SPD in a very disappointing third.\nThis has resulted in speculation that   Scholz could face a fate similar to Joe \nBiden’s—a leader seemingly unaware of   just how unpopular he’s become, potentially \npushed out before the next election cycle.  But - what do you think?
