    "transcription": "sixty percent of all new graduates in the EU are women yet 68 of board members and 92 percent of board chairs are men in fact there are more CEOs named Peter in the Netherlands than there are women CEOs altogether this is now set to change as the European Parliament has finally passed the directive on gender quotas for corporate boards this video will explain what this new EU directive is what this means for the EU member states and whether this is beneficial to the EU before explaining the directive we first need to understand the difference between executive and non-executive directors in companies executive directors are involved in the routine management of a company and are full-time employees they are paid a salary and implement the board's decisions they include CEOs MDS CFOs and so on non-executive directors are members of a company's board but don't have actual management responsibilities they are paid a service fee and offer strategic advice guidance and decision making but no actual implementation the EU directive on gender quotas wants to regulate these positions giving member states two options either 40 of the underrepresented sex needs to be represented as part of the non-executive directors or 33 of the underrepresented sex needs to be represented as part of all directors small companies with fewer than 250 employees are exempt from this ruling companies must also provide information about their gender representation once per year and member states are required to set up penalty systems for companies that fail to meet these new standards by June 2026 such as fines or publicly naming and shaming the company ultimately member states can also face penalties themselves from the EU if standards are not met so what does this mean for EU member states well here's a list of the EU countries with the average representation of women in their companies on average 11 EU countries already have at least 33 percent women on their boards with France leading the way 16 EU countries are below this threshold with Hungary Cyprus and Estonia at the bottom of the list with 10 or lower this means that this new directive will impact them the hardest but the question remains will someone like Orban even implement this law so is this new director beneficial well it obviously works as eight countries already have National equivalents and all of them rank quite high in the EU in terms of female representation according to the EU this will ultimately boost economic growth improve competitiveness and Tackle demographic challenges however several countries argue that the issue of gender balance in company boards is a matter for National governments not the EU another criticism is that the use of quotas could lead to companies to appoint women to board seats based on gender rather than Merit but what do you think good law or bad law let me know in the comments and please like the video and subscribe until next time"
