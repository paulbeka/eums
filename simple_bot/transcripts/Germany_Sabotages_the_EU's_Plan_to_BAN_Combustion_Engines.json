    "transcription": "foreign Germany the eu's largest economy is quickly becoming the eu's biggest Troublemaker in an effort to protect this automotive industry Germany is blocking the final approval of the eu's plan to stop the sale of new combustion engine cars by 2035. this law would have made electric cars the norm from 2035 onwards what makes it so surprising is that the ban was all but a done deal as the EU Parliament and the EU countries including Germany agreed on this deal only a few months ago other member states are making their feelings heard claiming that Germany went back on its word and that Schultz the German Chancellor will go down in history as the one that killed the green deal so why is Germany blocking the deal the free Democratic party one of the three parties making up Germany's ruling Coalition is spearheading the movement citing the need for openness to new technologies they claim that combustion engines should continue to be sold as long as they use so-called e-fuels which they claim are climate neutral but what are e-fuels if you have a similar chemical structure to Conventional fuels like petrol unlike fossil fuels e-fuels are produced by combining hydrogen from water with carbon dioxide from the air using renewable electricity this results in a liquid or gas similar to petrol diesel or methane ethos can be used in current internal combustion engines without modification which reduces emissions while keeping our current Vehicles they're similar to traditional fuels and use existing distribution networks avoiding the cost of new charging infrastructure however e-fuels have been criticized for their poor Energy Efficiency compared to electric vehicles according to the international Council on clean Transportation 48 of renewable electricity used to convert e-fills into liquid is lost along the process while up to 70 percent of the fuel's energy is lost upon combustion resulting in a 16 overall efficiency in contrast electric vehicles have a 72 percent efficiency rate with only 10 percent of electricity lost in charging and 20 percent lost by the motor in other words an electric car can travel five to six times further than its e-petual counterpart using the same amount of renewable electricity lastly burning e-fuels in a combustion engine still creates pollutants so it won't necessarily improve city air quality e-fuels May therefore be more practical for difficult to Electrify sectors like Aviation or Maritime transport so what happens now well Schultz made it clear that Berlin's not backing down until the EU commission presents a proposal to include e-fuels in the 2035 legislation and Germany has found allies together with Italy Poland and Bulgaria which have also voiced objections to the EU law Germany can form a blocking minority which prevents the EU from adopting the zero emissions mandate this means further compromises will have to be made in our opinion this is a blow to EU solidarity firstly promises aren't kept which makes it hard for a union of countries to successfully work together secondly this sets a precedent as EU countries will continue to place their national interests above European interests which may result in climate goals which are in everyone's interest not being met let us know what you think in the comments and subscribe to the channel and as always please consider signing up to patreon if you want to support this channel further until next time"
