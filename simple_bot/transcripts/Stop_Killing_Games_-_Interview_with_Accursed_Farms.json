    "transcription": "e e e e hello hello how's everyone doing can you hear me all okay or grand just need to check that the audio and the visuals all working everything kosher everything good okay I'm getting confirmation sound all right welcome to the EU Made Simple live stream this Wednesday night I hope you're all doing very well now the eagle wide among you might have noticed that I'm not lambertus I know it's a big shark right no I'm afraid the boss isn't here tonight my name's Nile I'm one of the writers for the E port and I'll be filling in for lambertus for this Stream So I know I have some pretty big shoes to fill and that you're probably all clamoring for Lambert's return but if you can put your pitchforks aside for just one second and bear with me I'm sure we'll have a great evening together so first things first a big shout out goes to bedor shashkov I'm sorry I've probably slaughtered the pronunciation for your name but um B was a big fan of the eem simple um he emailed us about I think about last week and he told us all about the stop killing games initiative which we'll be talking to uh with Ross in just a second here so uh he's the one that got interested in it so thank you Fedor for making all of this happen been a big help I also want to talk about the big giveaway that we have we're giving away free patreon memberships to the channel uh so this gives you access to like you know the Discord Early Access to videos and a chance to chat with us in the team so all you need to do to qualify is to tag the live stream in your Instagram stories and the first free to do so will be given a citizen level membership so the first tip um all the links for that is in the description and it's all on us right so introductions over let's get into it shall we tonight we have a special guest for the live stream his name is Ross and he runs the YouTube channel called accursed Farms which focuses on gaming where he talks to Industry experts and produces the series Freeman's mind recently he's been Making Waves as he actually launched a campaign a European citizens initiative specifically called stop killing games I'll let Ross introduce the project himself in just a second but safe to say if you're a gamer you'll definitely want to listen to what he has to say especially if you live in the European Union that's very important so without further Ado I'd like to welcome Ross from a cursive Farms to the stream Ross good me good to meet you how are you good thanks for having me yeah of course no worries all right what we'll do is I'll ask some questions to get the ball rolling and then later on we'll take some questions from the chat uh if that works for you so remember to put a q and a semicolon in the chat if you want to ask a question so that we can see it and yeah super chats get priority as well so if you have a burning question for Ross make sure to send that through and you know we'll give it special attention so very quickly Ross just um can you give us like a quick business pitch rundown of what the stop killing games initiative is sure uh the very basic version is we're trying to let customers who have bought paid money for video games keep them when support ends uh most video games work indefinitely you know you buy them and they'll last as long as the hardware does software but more and more being designed to connect straight to the publisher and act effectively as a kill switch so the for the games like that when the support ends all every copy that was ever sold ends also and we think this is well we know this is preventable it's rather we think this is rather anti-consumer and we're trying to prohibit that practice in the EU specifically and we're not trying to stop them from selling games like that but to have a responsible way of handling them once they end support and shut them down yeah so the bottom line is through this initiative anyone who buys a game will always have access to it like you know indefinitely kind of they won't ever have it cut from them sort of thing that that's the general goal it can get more complex than that but that's a good of course summary of it um and very quickly you know why not just tell us a bit about yourself you know you're from the US but you're based in the EU is that right yes I've been living in Poland for several years now uh my wife is Polish met her and didn't have much time me down move here I'm a YouTuber who's kind of made various kind of random videos usually related to gaming they're usually just goofy comedies kind of thing this is this entire project is a giant detour from what I'm normally doing again I I kind of hope to get back to what I was normally doing at some point uh but I've always enjoyed video games and this year I saw an opportunity to act on it which kind of snowballed into many activities to it's always bothered me the practice of have of seeing them destroyed yeah was there like any specific thing you saw like or that gave you the idea you know like any spark moment sort of thing well a little bit uh I mean it it's bothered me for decades but it's just kind of grown slowly over time but this year in particular uh a major game shut down called The Crew it was published by Ubisoft and this one was a unique opportunity to act on because it had I think at least 12 million players total and but more importantly Ubisoft is based in France so many different laws apply to it that that are very Pro consumer as opposed to Ones based in the United States or several other countries so this made it an ideal opportunity to act on uh I had been waiting for some sort of opportunity like this I considered the game OverWatch prior to this but that that hadn't had complications that made it harder to explain to regulators and they're also based in the United States with yeah they have outlets in the EU but it get really confusing how the law impacts that and that sort of thing so yeah I that makes sense like I guess this leads on to like another question that I want to ask ask actually why specifically did you target the EU I think I think I could be wrong that you have done stuff with the UK government as well is it really just because the EU has like a an easier way of like you know passing this kind of legislation of getting your voice heard it actually hasn't been specifically the EU it's been Global I saw this as my one chance to try to push back against this practice because I kind of see it it have a vibe that feels like our rights or eroding especially on this issue so when I saw the opening I did all the research I could asked for help across the internet just to see where everywhere we could possibly do something and we've had petitions like you mentioned in the UK uh also in Canada also in Australia and we've contacted consumer protection agencies in France Germany and Australia uh we there was a possibility of a lawsuit actually in Brazil but that one's kind of hit a wall a bit so yeah I wouldn't count on that one but the E the European citizens initiative was just something I discovered in the whole research process that I realized wow this might actually work if we could get the that many numbers I was thinking well can we get that many numbers I really don't know but I mean I guess I'm only losing time to try to give it a shot so that's what's brought me here I guess yeah and I think uh a very quick explanation of what a citizens initiative is like as you've explained this is something that concerns you know it's Global right it's not just the EU but specifically for the EU that's the channel obviously um a Citizens initiative is basically you get a whole bunch of signatures for like a kind of petition um from across the EU you have to get a million I believe it is and have pass a certain threshold in at least seven member states and then once that is reached it goes to the commission the European commission and the commission has to look at the proposal and then you know it doesn't necessarily mean it has to pass but they have to deliberate on it and it gets a lot more attention than say like a normal petition would um like you know through other means like change.org and stuff like that just for those who who weren't uh who weren't quite aware of how it works it it's kind of a unique feature of the uh of the EU I'm just going to take some questions from the chat very quickly we actually got two super chats which is great great to have them in so early um this one is oh free even that's great uh no excuse me I need two um this one is from uh I believe this would be Nicholas Pros you guys are gonna have to get used to me mucking up these names okay because I I'm really not the best of it um so this is Super Chat from him he sent over 50 I believe this is Swedish Crona and he asks say this manages to pass what will be the consequences can companies stop selling games to the EU because they don't like this and could that be a risk well I guess the first part what are the consequences a lot of that will depend on how the EU interprets it but as we're let's say as we're intending I mean it's possible but I I would bet any amount of money against it because it's I think it's a complete Bluff the population of the EU is 450 million people that's a huge market and I I think the video game industry does make billions off of it yeah I guess just I guess I should say any major company saying this for there there could be some smaller companies that could get caught in the crossfire a little bit in the transition of it but even then I think they would adapt or else other companies would rush in to take their Market market share so if they did pull out that's the thing about what we're proposing what we're asking for is end of life plans and this is actually relatively what's the word I'm looking for well okay it's I would say it's extremely achievable if it's done from the design phase onward like if a game has already been made everything was all the work was put into it but then this was never even considered that can be a nightmare to deal with ever if it's planned out from the beginning it's kind of like any other step of the game like okay the game's goingon to have sound the game's going to respond to a game pad or no we're gonna have a level it's just another element like every other aspect I've compared it to uh like car companies kind of fighting against having seat bels in their cars back in the 60s where yes that was an additional cost and more work and if your factory wasn't tooled for that that could be more of a but now I mean that's I'm estimating that's less than 1% of the cost of the car and I think it could be extremely similar no I I I see what you mean and I think most car companies are perfectly fine with putting SE bels in their cars and hopefully that could be something similar for video games going forward you know so why not yeah yeah I think it'll be leaving so much money on the table that that's the other aspect is especially once it's planned out and as time goes on when there's Sol middleware solutions for this sort of thing the cost would might fall to being almost negligible so they would have to decide okay what's better to pull out of the EU and lose millions of Euros in sales or to implement this one requirement at the end that we plan for that might depending on the game it might be a couple days work or you know it's companies like to make money so they tend to flow towards whatever makes them the most money especially larger ones yeah makes sense um I'm just going to get to another Super Chat because there are a few that are coming through it's great to see this guys honestly um this one is from politics for fun he's given two very simple question although not a simple answer I imagine he asked Ross do you prefer the EU or the US very easy depends on what you're talking about I mean I prefer the forest of the US from where I'm from from Virginia where it's considered a technically it's considered a temperate rainforest from where I'm from so the forest are more impressive though I did walk right by a poisonous snake back there so I don't miss that part uh it's a mix the way I look at moving to Europe the way I look at it is you ever seen a science fiction movie where there's time travel and they change something and in the future this is kind of an alternate reality so things the same but some are different that that's the overwhelming feeling I get some things are very different other things are practically identical so sure it's a mix you know yeah that makes sense I think a lot of people can empathize with that um here's another Super Chat from the Scout from TF2 himself wow an esteemed guest we have here so uh he's given five pounds he's asked have you contacted Gamescom to get a booth there to promote the petition no I haven't I some people were talking about possibly doing that yeah feel free if you like anything about this you don't have to wait on me this whole thing is kind of anarchic with how we're going about it trying to get attention I mean getting a booth that would involve a lot of travel additional cost and we'd have to weigh how many we could get there but that would yeah it's a possibility that's the other thing we haven't been fundraising for this either we've just yeah that may change at some point but I'm adamant about not even touching that till just like a full plan of or close to it of what it would be spent on I'm not gonna I figure I'd rather lose on this for free rather than lose and take a lot of money for it yeah that makes sense um yeah I'm afraid I can't really help on that front either I've I've only been to like One gaming um event in person I think it was like 16 was like London Expo or something like that I played a VR game that was like really bad so I'm afraid I wouldn't know much about it um so we kind of both lost that se on that front um I actually had a few questions from that were sent through from a patreon member who was really um invested in this topic their name is imra again pronunciation might be completely off um and they wanted to know for this initiative what platforms specifically would you be talking about is it only PC games or would it include console and mobile games too I think the the reason for that question is because if I'm not mistaken that things can be changed with PC games compared to console and mobile games yeah the this okay well well the short answer is we're going for video games period so this would include mobile this would include console now that does present more technical challenges uh to give an example let's say it was a game where you need to connect and the server that's hosting the files This Server software let's just say it's so complex it just simply can't run on the console or the mobile device it just it's an impossibility what we would try to push for would be to release some again we're mostly focusing on future games here so present games a lot of things could happen but we're talking about let's talk hypothetically about a game in the future What would happened then is when that when they're done so when the publisher is done supporting that game and they want to shut it down they would release some version of that server software that would have to run on another platform and then configure the client side that's on the console or the mobile device that can point to a different location where that server will be hosted so there will be a little more Do-it yourself aspect to it with that uh now where it gets tricky especially for consoles is sometimes you have to pay money just to access the internet period so that it would still remove the liability off the game publisher but maybe onto the console maker and what wouldn't be clear is if the console maker will be required to allow you to connect to that server while it was supporting it or only once they discontinu the console itself so the details of this can get numerous yeah many things but yeah no we're trying to aim for everything gotcha so in in like if I've understood you right and I'm afraid on my side I I don't the technical side is kind of lost to me but you could have like um you know fan run servers as long as the the source code is made available that's kind of like all you're really asking for right well well not even that uh when well yes for the first part that that would that would pretty much have to be the solution for many types of games except the part about source code that would be optional that's what we're not trying to mandate source code be given up that's source code is extremely helpful but that companies can have many reasons to want to withhold their source code in those cases we would need some sort of binary for the server to run at something which which means that for not technical people that means if you just run it it's a program that runs now it might not be designed for the system that you bought the game for and could be for custom server Hardware or something exotic but you just click and it run source code means you can read everything that that software does make changes whatever you have the keys to the kingdom once you have source code and so while that's appreciated we would not be mandating that we we we be kind of be pushing for de Publishers or developers to find their own solution and just have the requirement that there's a reasonable expectation that the customer can run the game in some form once support is ended gotcha okay that makes sense um let me just ask oh imra has said Thank You Ross for the answer uh I can see that there are way more uh questions in this than what we know now uh I will get back to another question that imra has asked uh but I do want to just ask something uh from the chat um La has asked should oh should the US have popular initiatives like these I take it you probably agree with that well should would be yes I'd agree with should what I found with the US was the closest thing we probably had was a open ballot initiative that you could propose it on a ballot during an election however what I found was in order for that to even reach that phase it you could only previous voters were allowed to partake in the initial proposition process so I was think my my thoughts were I'm not sure how many like already registered voters that are also Gamers that are going to be on board with plus this is if I'm being real this is kind of a niche issue I mean I once you get into broad politics you know there could be many more important factors plus the law in the US it it's on this issue it's kind of upside down compared to many other countries where this is extremely locked down this can actually circumvent most state law and I've heard from mult or read from multiple lawyers pretty much the only solution to this in the United States is through an act of Congress I just do not have the confidence that I would be able to influence that in any level yeah that makes sense I mean I guess this kind of um you know you mentioned it was a niche you know uh subject and and I know that we mentioned in our video on the topic that you know the video game industry actually makes more than the music industry and the film industry combined so yeah it is a big industry but there's no denying that it's relative Niche um the question that I would have is let's say I'm a European citizen right but I have no interest in video games whatsoever why should I sign or even care about this initiative well the number one reason I'd have to give is this could spread I almost see this as a like a contagion where see what's going on is it's not even clear under the law if these are goods or services yeah that that's something we're having investigated because most of these games you buy them as a one-time purchase with no stated expiration date well that part sounds like a good but they they rely on an external service which you're given no frame when it ends they just say it can end at any time well imagine well you might not even need to imagine for some things imagine applying that to other actually I think with some cars they have heated seats that depend on a service where you have to dial in order for that to work yeah what if was your car engine that starts working like that yeah or uh let's see I've given examples like maybe medical devices or farm equipment or education tools things that we start getting out of the realm of video games which are not ultimately not that big a deal but this stuff could be really important and you're kind of I almost think of video games as just a almost like a laboratory to see what companies can get away with because if they can run it here then they can let's say move it to again something like cars or Vehicles they can disable elements of it that you used to have automatically when you bought a car and then they can point to video games so saying well there's a long history of setting things up so that we can disable things via kill switch remotely you know so yeah it's this is very this is very much a consumer rights issue just across the board that's not actually where my motivation comes from on it but that's 100% where almost all our openings in the law on it are yeah that makes sense so like it's you know maybe you don't care about video games specifically but if you're interested in protecting consumer rights this is a pretty big deal especially the way that you're framed it therepe with like the car um the engine especially I didn't even thought of that but that would be pretty pretty vital um just very quickly I I wanted to uh shout out the EU simple Twitter space um just very quickly uh we post Daily News there updates on the channel if you want to stay in touch with the channel that's your best place to do so for all the fans watching right now um I'll take a few more questions from the chat I've got one from uh Goa kirkl uh he asks or they ask sorry about that would the games be required to be made available for purchase or for free or will the files be only available to those who purchased before shutdown I think we'd have to go with they would only be available to existing customers now however companies could always decide that okay we're not making any money off of it we're shutting it down they could just decide to release it for free in fact some companies will do that now with some of their older titles just as a promotion thing but in order for them to in order for them to just release it for free that would have to upend existing copyright law which would just that would be a nightmare to consider so it would only be for existing customers that paid into it they would be the only ones entitled to an end of Life Plan while that's less than ideal for preservation it's just I'm trying to maximize our odds on having any progress on this yeah I think that's a good strategy keep it as you know kind of focused as possible you know and open to success I think that's a good way to go about it another question here from GES who asks hi Ross what do you think about AI based online games like sucker as I understand what they're selling is not just a game itself but also tokens to run the text models on their servers now I'll be honest I've not even heard of any of these kind of games but what what you think about that well I think that falls under there's a general there's some games that are just so massive in scope that again the home system would never be able to run them yeah what we're trying to push I think AI could potentially fall under that kind of category where where you would need like rows of machines to run it I what we're trying to push in that kind of scenario would be what I'm calling like a best effort solution or okay so for an AI based game let's say you need like you know three rows of computers custom Hardware in order to run it the way it's meant to be run and that's not doable well what they could do is still release the binaries or the source code or maybe just even lots of instructions as to how it works to give the more technically Savvy users a chance to kind of repair it yeah that's another aspect to this when these games are shut down they're usually really locked down to the point where repair is completely unrealistic even for advanced programmers it's kind of like locking it in a safe and throwing it in the ocean yeah uh so as long as they gave an a fighting chance to be able to run the game like then I think that would be good enough because in theory if the community really valued this game they could go rent or buy their own custom AI hardware and try to get this software running on it as a second life kind of thing so but now that may not happen well either way it's not the company's fault then you know the customers paid money to them they ran the game for a while they shut it down and they gave them the tools to continue Run the game if they wanted to well then I I can't see how you could hold the company liable past that because we want them to be able to wash their hands of a game whenever they want and just the customers themselves can decide how much it's worth it to them to keep running you know yeah it's definitely tricky I think there are a lot more factors involved I think then maybe people initially yeah actually if I could mention one because I'm almost certain it'll come up uh in some cases especially for present games it may be legally impos excuse me legally imp possible for them to do this where they've already signed contracts and have licenses with other software companies where that company has permission to run the server for that game but they they cannot give that out without breaking the law or breaking their contract and we're trying we have there are options for games like that within our initiative that's why we're primarily focusing on future games like the options a lot of this will depend on what the EU says says but the Surefire option would be they could shut down that game before the law went into effect that would be less than ideal however depending on yeah I should mention I'm not an official initiative member I mean I'm in touch with all of them but this will not be my decision so I can't speak for all of them but one thing I might be willing to compromise on if it was the only way to make it happen will be the grandfather in existing games so okay you have a game like Final Fantasy online where uh they do not have permission to give up the server software they or they never will they can't Ren renegotiate that well since they were operating before this went to effect then they can continue operating as they were but a new game made would not they would fall have the rules fall underneath it so so if an if it's a known requirement in the EU I think that would make negotiating with these other software vendors M much more viable that hey we C literally cannot use your software unless we're allowed to have an end of life plan with you so we have options for the legal legal pickups that arise from this yeah you know like I like I said it's um there are so many different factors that people wouldn't even consider like you know when I first read up on on the initiative I thought to myself you know well first of all I couldn't quite believe that there were single player games that required you to be online to play them you know that was really show I when I was growing up uh you know you put the disc into the GameCube fired up a paper Mario or something and you good to go you know um I've played online games of course but it was like many multiplayers so that really shocked me first of all um but when you know so I feel like okay well this is like slam dunk right for the initiative but when you get into it there are a lot of different things that come into it you're like yeah hold on do we have to make the developers keep these servers running indefinitely it's like no not necessarily no no not at all not at all% no that that's our answer yeah and it's like uh yeah there's just so many different factors to come into it but you know it sounds like you guys have got a lot of it ired out so that's great to hear um I'll just take a ah we've got a Super Chat that came through right here so that's great thank you draa who asked uh well he sent through I think this is Norwegian chroner 50 Norwegian kroner um to Ross specifically how did you learn about duelist if I had to triple check that I heard you right I worked on its Revival let me know if you need info well not specifically since as I understand it that game's safe now we're not worried about the safe game oh that's another thing to mention that maybe wasn't obvious this would have no impact on the vast majority of video games so if a game shuts down and you don't need to connect to the publisher mission accomplished it was never even affected yeah yeah for duelist I found out about that precisely because it's a game that was handled properly with its shutdown where it used to be online only but then they shuttered it but they release I don't remember the details if it was the source code or just the server uh they released enough relevant code that people could continue running it and then now the game's safe which is the responsible way to handle this sure makes sense um I was actually wondering because I saw the the initiative and the numbers um like and the the the map I seem to get the impression that there's a lot of traction this coming from Scandinavian countries like northern Europe and specifically Finland actually do do you have any idea why what that is I have no idea I I'm just this is as much an unknown to me as it is to you I I guess maybe there's more English speakers that could maybe because my audience is going to be English speaking in fact I think that's our biggest challenge is to try to yeah for anyone watching this which is to help the number one thing you can do to help is try to reach out to other game YouTubers or anything like that that don't speak English like Italian Spanish uh Hungarian whatever like that is just invaluable to have people like that that can kind of Link the two worlds on this yeah for sure and I saw there wasn't much well I think there was a decent amount but he hadn't passed the threshold um in Ireland and I was a little bit disappointed by that I was like you know come on guys you the the only English speaking Tech Like official Lang or Malta actually never mind Mal Malta needs to pick up the tracks you know we're not the only ones I lost my train of thought oh I was oh yeah what I wanted to say is don't even worry about the thresholds too much if we get if we can actually cross the 1 million Mark I think we'll easily have our threshold so I think so don't even pay attention to that just get more the main number is the one that matters yeah the the threshold I think was put in place right so that you wouldn't just get like a million French people like you know put in an initiative that only considered like yeah French people so this kind of petition you don't even really have to to mind that because it's going to be so spread out across the EU um ah I'll take a question from imra again um they've asked Ross said all platforms all games are we talking about console platforms like keeping alive PS5 servers even after 20 to 30 years from now or strictly only games uh playability you might have answered this one but maybe you want to clarify a bit uh I I think they would be intertwined but well first off the company like so mentioned PlayStation Sony would not be liable for keeping that platform going however I this is where the details really matter uh and that that's an unknown before it goes before the EU commission but some examples I could think of would be let's say Sony shuts down the PlayStation five and they don't really provide Provisions for this other than they allow the console to connect to the internet once they've shut it down without having to go through them uh and they've made it so that their their own published games can run unassisted like I mentioned earlier like there could be an option to run the server on another platform if it wasn't possible on the console um as long it's all about just is it possible this is not about convenience at all like it's it's much because it's with other products you know it's understandable if the manufacturer doesn't keep supporting them but as long as they're not preventing repair that can be a huge Factor yeah or even just access to right yeah consoles are kind of are trickier because it can vary depending on the console how much you're allowed to kind of access and dial out because that could be a security risk while they're supporting it and so they may not want to allow you to connect to just some random server on their console because then that's work for them in which case I mean that that would be less ideal for the customer but as long as it's possible once they finally discontinue the console so it can kind of come back to life in that way and they have no more liability then I would still see that as acceptable if not ideal but it can get that's that's the thing to understand in terms of preservation for being able to keep a game that you've purchased the industry has been going down the wrong road with just almost complete abandon on this issue for decades I'd say at this point yeah so it there's so much that we have to kind of tiptoe around and walk back to some degree just to make this happen I mean ideally that we this conversation would be happening 15 years ago but that's not I had to wait until there was an opportunity on it so yeah makes sense right um very quickly going to take a another question from a super chat um this one is from ma jetti gizzle uh who sent $5 or $4.99 for US dollars so you know broad representation across the globe here so that's great um is it okay if we leverage Ai and other Tech to create dubs of your videos um so I take it that's stop killing games videos for re-upload asking out of curiosity yeah as long as you're either not misrepresenting me or if you are you make it obvious it's AI you know so it's not like you're not trying to make like a a fake and then pass it off as real so yeah that makes sense yeah just keep an eye out you might my general policy is anything resembling fair use on my videos is fine so that's an American law but there's equivalence in Europe I forget what the term is um no I keep an eye out for for any videos where you might find yourself saying uh unw things in a dub or something maybe someone yeah just put like and the credits or the quarter like not actually Ross or AI or something if it's yeah that makes sense it's it's a clever idea because I hadn't even thought that you know um we've talked about uh at the channel we talked about you know dubbing and we've got different languages um you know and stuff like that because obviously it's EU so many different languages out there um and there are lots of features on YouTube that let you you know change the language by region so someone if a French person is watching it will get automatically put into their language and stuff but yeah and that AI dub I suppose would work as well um a bit I would I I'd feel a bit weird watching it of myself you know it feel a bit uncanny valley but yeah probably would well if it was a dub over it might work or if I'm talking and then there's a voice on top of that yeah I think that could yeah why not listen the more the word gets out you know for any kind of initiative you know I always think that's a great thing um let me take another question this one is um from Monkey who says Let's imagine that the initiative turns into law what would be your ideal outcome which aspects would you want to see implemented to consider the whole effort a success just having a requirement that there's some way to run to either run or repair the game upon shutdown that that that's one thing if there's anything about this initiative you don't like I'm actually open to any solution that solves the problem this is my and the or especially the organizers best attempt at it you know we're we kind of feel like we're standing alone here on this because my impression is that if this and our other legal efforts fail I don't think there's going to be a round two I think apathy's going to win the day and then the law has spoken so there's no more angle you need to take advantage of momentum right you know you've got a lot at the minute yeah the the initiative has really exploded online um and I I it's quite similar like funnily enough this this kind of relates to politics there's some you know uh similar things here like in I know it's not technically the EU or it was at the time but up in Scotland they had a vote on Independence right and there was a lot of momentum to do with it you know um fairly close result well 55% voted no so stayed in the UK um and then as stuff about the EU and brexit happen everyone kind of thought okay we've got another shot at this right we can go again you know we can build a momentum and they found it was just a lot harder to do so you know um not even just that uh I don't I think younger Gamers especially M may not even realize what we're asking for is completely possible you know I think there's many younger people even Gamers so I think the perception has been shifting since the industry has been again going down this road more and more yeah so I think if we were to try this even if we have momentum trying this in five 10 years we would might not even get the critical mass because they would think we're asking for unicorns and rise to the moon when you know the people who are actually designing this stuff know better but that can be more of the old guards so gotcha I'm going to get through the flurry of super chats we' had this is great to see guys um got four super chats in a row so you know strap in um the first one comes from Jes who sent $5 again from the US what if a company may take down a property to save costs while they negotiate to sell IP to another company yeah that's that that's one's a bit of an unknown because okay but like the question I heard was something like what if the company goes bankrupt well if that happened then the any penalties would likely be Financial so it would be kind of moood point and that wouldn't save games but then there would be much more incentive to treat them properly because it be intertwined but if they want to sell the shutter it to sell down the property that I think the EU would have to answer a question like that because the the question is whose liability is it and I think there's a sent of either way to keep it going because it could either be the original rights holders that okay well you're selling the intellectual property but you took the money for from customers on this so you still are responsible or the new rights holder buying it would be on the hook saying okay well if you're buying this property you're assuming these not exactly debts exactly but this liability that you have to make good on the existing customers M it's possibility they might find a loophole around it but again it always comes down to like what is the most costeffective option and I think this could be extremely coste effective especially as time moves on that it just wouldn't even be worth the effort to have these kind of back flips to get out of it makes sense okay going to get on to the next Super Chat um this one is from TG TJ sorry buyers in the US he sent $5 um this one's less of a question and and more just a statement the man just wanted to cruise virtual America the industry forced his hand Mr Scott is brilliant so there you go you got a big thumbs up well it it was for the record I would have done this for any game that met the criteria but it's just a coincidence I also enjoyed the game that was the trigger point for all of this so makes sense makes sense okay we've got one from migran five euro how much lost functionality is considered reasonable MMO minus online might be playable but a MOBA minus online is the same as dead so MOBA is like you know league and DOTA and stuff like that I presume well if it's um if it's a game that most of the core the the short version is there's not going to be a hard answer on this but it's kind of a spectrum so it may not need every single feature so let's say like there's a leaderboard or something or some stat tracking that would have in something like a MOA and that doesn't work in the end of Life Plan well as long as the core gameplay works that's all right now you bring up an interesting point that if this was offline well a MOBA most mobile games are meant to be played online with other people so if it's only working single player that could be seen as not going far enough and you would need something like local hosting where yeah you know somebody hosts the server and then others connect to it or vice versa uh so there there would probably need to be multiplayer functionality on some level for that however if it's a game where let's say the multiplayer was just felt kind of tacked on and was never interesting anyway but it had a great single player aspect to it maybe they maybe that might fly and I think the way it would be determined would probably be by how many how many customers would be motivated to file complaints with their local consumer protection agencies where I I'm not sure what the goverment in body of that would be but okay so let's say you know it's missing a few features I think the vast majority of people are going to say great and still play the game however let's say you it technically starts but then all that happens is you get into a main menu and then that's it there's nothing else no Gameplay at all well then I think a lot of people would not consider that a reasonable uh me reasonably meeting the requirements yeah of course it's I would compare it to something like if you got a let's say you had a warranty for some sort of item and you asked for a replacement but then the replacement had problems okay what are the problems does it have like a small scratch on the side or does the catch on fire when you turn it on you know I I think it would be similar to that that makes sense to to be honest uh when it comes to MMO not MMOs mobo specifically um I think that this I don't know proba probably a few games in there one in particular League of Legends that I wouldn't be too sad to seeo to be honest I've had my fair share of bad experiences on there um no offense right but this is from a scout from TF2 who paid five pounds to ask would Indie devs not be affected by this or would they have to follow the laws when the law are in place in the future I think that there are a few Indie Dev Studios that have actually uh talked about this initiative already right yeah I mean it it all depends well first first off if when they end support for their game you don't have to connect to that developer or publisher then they're already examed so they don't have to worry about and that's most Indie Games yeah but but let's say they do uh I guess a lot of this depends on what the EU decides but some options I could see well the one that would be Surefire if this passed would be they it's I admit it's less than ideal but they could shut it down before the law went into effect and then be compliant that way uh again I mentioned the possibility that the what they could possibly be grandfathered in or that that was another consideration maybe developers earning below a certain amount get grandfathered in and only the bigger ones have to adhere to it I again I'm open to some compromises but let's say it's a game in the future well if it's a game in the future I think pretty rapidly we would see middleware Solutions emerge middleware is software that's meant to kind of be in between the main game and what the developers are doing to make their lives easier where you know like so say there's like a physics engine they want to just put in there so they don't have to come up with their own physics that sort of thing I think we would see a what I'm calling a gold rush of middleware options emerge for for making end of life plans easy so you want to make a multiplayer game but we're GNA have features that mean you can just hit a few buttons and then you could have a build that you can release once your game has reached its end of life and then you're in full compliance because this would create the demand for that having this requirement I think the market would just rush in to fulfill it because again there's money on the table then for that sort of solution so however if you were making a game that you plan to release right as the it's coming into effect that could be a problem but may again this all depends on the EU maybe you could be considered a special case that you could apply for permission to release to be grandfathered and even though you technically missed the deadline by a month or something like that again I'm open to any solution that gets us to the Finish Line on this sounds good yeah very much open to compromise very much in the EU Spirit of things um very quickly I just wanted to shout out asuman kubra Bas who has just joined the channel as a member um you know as a citizen so that's great to great to see welcome asan good to have you here uh thank you very much for joining I'll get on to another Super Chat you know kind of crazy the amount they're coming through thank you very much guys um from dead agent who has given five to ask have you considered malicious compliance where say an MMO is made to be offline but the patch makes online Resurrection via private servers harder I think that's well again I think it's possible I think most developers wouldn't do that because they figure all right we have to meet the requirement anyway it I think most of them would want people to play the game and if it's mandatory in order to sell in the EU anyway they might as well just you know go for the path of least resistance because if they're going for malicious compliance it's almost like they're going out of their way to make it harder and and I mean are they do they hate this so much for a game that they're no longer making money on that they want to take on more work to make their entire player base's lives harder it's possible for some I think and plus if it got to extreme levels then we would go back to the thing about how many features are missing in order for this to work like if there's no reason if there's a way no reasonable person could be expected to get this running even a knowledgeable you know programming professional then that could be considered there might be a penalty for that going out of their way to do it but yeah not impossible but I think it would be a pretty small minority of ones attempting that gotcha um listen just because I mean we're getting so many questions and you know it's great to see the chat so engaged and all that this is are you okay if this goes a bit over time then maybe sure I actually didn't even remember your limit was I think we were looking at like an hour or so but we've got okay what it's your show go ahead noise I just don't want to make sure you you know you wasn't taking up too much of your time but that's great um got another Super Chat here from Nathan Cassidy um who gave $999 there's a fanmade mod for escape from tarov a very popular multiplayer game that turns into a single player game okay so the mod turns it into a single player game it's totally possible to fix games like mobas and MMOs if fans get their hands on the code yeah there can like I mentioned earlier there can be well often legal obstacles to that now uh for existing games that's what we're trying to remove for the future and the other developers can have legitimate reasons to want to withhold their source code I mean so we're not trying to mandate that just some solution yeah that makes sense um and another one coming through from Cake zombie $5 who asks this is actually a question that uh I was interested in I think you've covered part of it already what are the chances of the stop killing games initiative succeeding longterm and what can I do as an American to support it well there's two phases to that one we have to get the signatures and I have no idea what our odds are on that this is all complete unknown to me I think in my video promoting this I even said I'm this might be delusional I don't know yet yeah so uh but assuming we get the signatures nothing's a guarantee but I think this really Falls in line with existing EU consumer practices and we're trying to be as reasonable as possible that I I I personally would bet money that this solves the problem to a significant degree but I would bet nothing on whether we get the signatures or not and I know it's frustrating as American not being able to do anything on this honestly the best thing you could do is just try to reach out to people who might qualify so maybe some gaming communities that do have some European influence in them or just maybe demographics that might be unaware of this like some examples I've heard are things like Esports games or maybe like military Sims yeah or just Ju Just any sort of the more niches in there the better you know to try to get a long tale effect yeah I mean the internet is kind of like an Open Marketplace right you never know who's listening so even if you're an American and you know you put out a social media post supporting it that might be seen by like you know some guy in czechia and they a European citizen they can sign it you know and and this is my bias but I think this is going to be it for your chances to actively do something because our other legal action is almost all underway except for some stuff in the UK so if for something to participate in this is probably it and from and again from this is my subjective opinion but I don't think you're gonna get another chance on this so you can maybe mention that part yeah that I I tend to agree I think to be honest as sad as it may be but yeah um dead agent has sent another Super Chat 5 years asking how would the preservation for microtransactions work okay for M yeah for microtrans that's a good point didn't mention this on here uh we actually are trying okay for free for truly free games in other words somebody just puts it up there's no sale or anything microtransactions this would have no impact on those even if they're online only this there's no Commerce going on so I just I think that would easily be overreached to go for that but if it's a free-to-play game where the game itself is free but then they sell features on it like a skin or extra account features like premium right yeah premium the way this will work is technically the customer would not be entitled to the game however if they're paying for these microtransactions as a one-time purchase and there is no stated expiration date then that really resembles a good in which case in order to access their microtransactions like the virtual skin they kind of need the game to work so it kind of loops around that way yeah that makes yeah so much of this is about how it's s how the game is sold yeah one type of game I mean we'll try but it's very likely it will fail would be subscription only Games like World of Warcraft Final Fantasy 14 that sort of thing because those really do meet the definition of a service for the most part you know you pay for 30 days of access or a year whatever you get your 30 days and then it's over and they told that all to you upfront yeah so there wasn't this you know you buy once and then we won't tell you how long that game last practice that's going on right now however that's so few games on the market I think it's literally under 10 there might be a couple I'm not that I'm not particularly worried about that and some people going to be worried about well won't this make all gamees subscription games because they can switch to that the thing is we've seen that happen already with MMO games in the 2000s where there were dozens of games with subscription fees and they almost all died out or went free to play because they just the that market is only so big most people don't want to pay money every month for one game then the next game then the next game because that just adds up so fast yeah so uh I think the market would have a containment effect on that and I think that's true even now because if it didn't we would be seeing more games come out that oh this is subscription only you know and companies seem to be pretty shy about that nowadays well funnily enough I think with like you know you mentioned like World of Warcraft um which to my knowledge is kind of the only real subscription based game that still exists um but there there's Final Fantasy 114 there's like the extra version of Eve online sure there's some space game I forgot the name of yeah uh track Mania that one's I haven't had a chance to research that one that that one is aspects of a de subscription sure I remember because like obviously me and my brother we played quite a lot of World of Warcraft back in the day you actually did have to buy like the physical copy so you bought a copy first and then you subscribed very much a money pit then like blizz so there was there's actually kind of an argument that gets into very murky territory but I wouldn't count on that winning yeah especially because when you buy it they're say it came with the 60 days of access or whatever the number was you know so they could argue that oh you were buying like a a subscription upgrade or something like that so that one's I mean we'll try but I expect that one to get shot down but yeah I think that's 1% of games so it's it's not a big share of the market and you'd be going up against the Titan light but is it I'm sure they they know their stuff we'll be going up against them anyway OverWatch would have checked off every box on this true um let me get to another Super Chat this one is again from the Scout from TF2 it's great to see you best best class in that game uh you worried companies will send lawyers to stop it I guess that kind of ties into what we just talked about there well lawyer I mean this is this is an area where you might answer this one better than I can this is where EU politics really come into play because right now this is being examined in consumer protection agencies in France and Germany how much suede does the industry have on consumer protection agencies I have no idea same goes for the Au commission I mean there is there is a video game lobbying group but I do not know how much that weighs against organic consumer interest at that level I mean maybe it's a lot maybe it's a little bit somebody who knows more about EU politics would have to answer that yeah I'm we we'd have to definitely look into it I don't want to say anything now and get it wrong um but okay we'll do something very easy here maybe not even related to the initiative itself on a more personal level you say what would you say is your favorite game of all time a favorite I I don't know if I I have a favorite of all time because they can be so different in them or you know it's a favorite one but I don't want to replay it I want to play other stuff or I mean some of my favorites are de sex uh Castlevania Symphony of the Night Super Metroid uh geez there's Supreme Commander you guys in the chat if you have your own you know show they billions yeah uh oh man I'm probably forgetting some others I'm sure I am so it's and then there's other games where in some ways they're my all-time favorite but then there's other elements I just hate about them all in the same game so you know so oh yeah it's all over so no I get that I think um it's interesting as well because I took a bit of an interest in this initiative as well um we mentioned it in the video we made Europe is quite a hub for video game development you know so we've got quite a few studios here both way and Indie that do very well like you know this this this continent is actually quite influential in the gaming market and as we said before that market is not to be sniffed at that brings up a good point relating to the last question I mentioned that video game Lobby group was it called vide game.eu that one's already come out against this however a major European developer not part of that group CD project I think they would support this because they have a great reputation for of caring about preservation of game so if they could get involved in the conversation at the political level somehow that would just be a complete Boon for what we're doing yeah I I think in the comment section of our video there were a few people that were shading them out actually you know um so who knows you know The Witcher the Cyber Punk yeah I think I could be wrong has laran Studios have they commented on it at all or I don't know I mean I I would think they would be in favor of it based on their comment Theory I've seen from them um ah we've got another Super Chat coming in from oh it's imra again thank you very much IM um they ask what if steam you know steam epic games platform I imagine anything like that renames purchases to subscriptions well they would have to do more than rename it uh because I mean I would think because if they just call it subscription we find then you're pay for how much every month you know uh and that that would that would that would be a massive PR backlash I imagine that but they kind of have a bit of a captive Market too uh because then even if it's just a penny well now you're paying money every month or every year or something and that creates a psychological backlash that I think people would not want uh and actually I think there some precedent against that there was the oh man I forgot how to pronounce it there was a court case in France uh against valve a few years ago Val versus the UFC shazir I I might be mispronouncing it but one of the conclusions that the lower court found was that the way steam was selling the games it made them more like Goods rather than Services because valve was trying to argue they're just a service but so it's again not impossible but it it the thing is we're seeing for those who are kind of worried about this like maybe making things worse or you know from where we're looking at it we don't have much to lose because the trajectory we're going on the number of games like this are increasing more and more that have this online only requirement and some big series are shifting towards that like I think heard the like Ubisoft trying to get the Assassin Creed series to go to online only yeah or I think that was it some of the Call of Duty games have transitioned to that so they're trying to Usher this in anyway so if we sit and do nothing then I I that's the thing taking no action actually is a decision also and I think the consequences in my eyes are riskier doing that than trying to get some Provisions no definitely agree um this one has come again from imra so thank you so much imra you've really been a big part of this whole project um who sent over 400 I believe that's Hungarian thant I think um they have said not necessary you can subscribe for until EOL I'm not sure of life I see gotcha so they' you can subscribe to okay well you have to say what yeah no no there's a catch to that in order to do that you would have to say how okay how long is your subscription is it two years five years and companies don't want to do that for two reasons one if they have a hit then they want to keep it going and not have to have a bunch of people bail on when they have to resubscribe or maybe make more money on it you know and if they have a FL flop they don't want to keep that game going for five years so it's by having an end of life plan they can end it sooner they can end it later it's all up to them it stays within their control whereas if they have if if they're going for a true subscription which again I think only the really big players can do that like mention World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 then uh most companies aren't going to be able to turn the same kind of profit that way and they're on the hook it by giving the time periods so um yeah I guess that kind of ERS um the question that jet 27 had um who asked do you think Publishers would opt to make games with an expiration date and yeah I think it's very much uh yeah I think they would far prefer to have have an end of life plan so they don't have to put that yeah exactly right um but yeah no that's great I think honestly like from a personal perspective this I think maybe it's a different era of gaming you know um like I said when I was growing up is very much um you buy a game you have that physical copy you put it in you play it right the idea of that being like taken away because you can't have online access to like from my perspective because I main play like single player games right for a single player game that's like mad to me you know um so maybe there's a bit of a disconnect because some people that's another thing the industry is heading in we have seen multiple games now with single player and multiplayer campaigns or modes merg together so you still have to connect like well the crew was like that the destiny uh Need for Speed from 2015 was uh the division games so these all have single play full single player campaigns but you have to connect online to get them so they're all merged together so you can't they're coming for this from every angle and you mentioned I'm still trying to find the first the the first one I know of is Guild Wars where that was 2005 that that came out I think prior to that every game or almost every game you either bought it and you got to keep it indefinitely Or it was a subscription so you're told exactly how long you have it and so this this is a relatively newer practice but oh and we've got another Super Chat from Scout from TF2 again ABS you know you know the goat of super chats tonight uh he has sent over2 will you be at the euq when talks begin but he has put in parenthesis in caps I've got no clue what this means so okay the EU commission uh if we get enough signatures I'll probably I think we found out I'm allowed to attend as an observer so yes I'll probably uh you know travel there to be there for it I can at leave consult with the organizers maybe but I will have no legal Authority whatsoever if I go yeah in fact if this passes the EU pays for the transportation of the initial members they won't pay for me so it's so yeah I will be there but not in that would be my plan to be there if if I could have any influence if I have just no influence and they have and I would just be like in a separate room or something I might consider skipping because then there would just be no point but I'd still be very interested you know yeah for sure just want to clarify something very quickly um because I made a little mistake there that was uh that parenthesis wasn't um wasn't actually included it was a member of the team who said that probably asking for me to uh explain further so he was just asking about the ehq so it's my mistake there my bad but yeah it's interesting because I don't know do you have dual citizenship no um I have a permanent residence permit but I I only have citizenship for the United States right so I don't I can't I cannot sign this yeah it's interesting because you're spearheading you know and you've created this movement and funnily enough you can't actually take part in it yourself whatever gets us yeah it's it's F and I should mention for those who feel like I'm trying to like invade on EU politics this is Global I would have gotten nowhere if there weren't I guess at this point hundreds of thousands of people that agreed with what we're trying to do so this is look I cannot tell you how many Americans I've heard from wish they could help with this you know yeah no for sure because America's kind of locked down legally and we're that's another thing is even if this initiative fails we're I'm still keeping my fingers crossed on the consumer agencies because half the battle on this is just finding out it could be this entire thing is redundant and France comes out and says no the way these games are being sold are Goods therefore all these laws all these directives on digital Goods Supply uh oh yeah I should mention it's not clear under the EU if they're considered goods or services and the EU does have directives on digital content which sounds like what these could be except those directives don't actually apply specifically to this because they'll say it's all about like okay well or you provide it for the state time frame or you the duration well the duration you're not given one it just says it can end at any time so does that mean you have no protections or does that mean this is considered Perpetual the law does not say and furthermore a lot of these license agreements were the like for example the crew it said that the Ubisoft can can can change the terms at any time uh it can terminate the contract at any time and uh if it does terminate it you are as a customer are required to destroy all copies of their game well having all those ter and again there's no stated date how long this lasts just at any time well the the EU commission has come out and said this could very likely be seen as a violation I know it now uh directive 9313 eec where their laws against unfair terms in contracts that make things one-sided against the consumer however they also said this has to be tested by the member states so it could be this is already illegal what's happening and everything we're doing is redundant which would make me ecstatic about it so but yeah this is kind of the backup the long shot backup here of course and like you know definitely don't ever think that you know anyone who would say like oh an an American is intruding on our politics it's complete rubbish because you've got it's European citizens who are signing this initiative you're allowed to create an initiative you know um if you've got a million European citizens who are backing an initiative you can't exactly say that it's Americans who are in like you know intruding on it so you know definitely don't want to hear that from anybody and I literally have no Authority in any Avenue we're operating it all has to come from citizens of those regions so yeah listen or the government you know yeah we're getting to the end of our time so guys if you have any more questions any more Super chats you know burning questions you want to get in now is the time we'll go through them um but we don't want to take up too much of a Ross's evening so we'll start with uh a super chat from thas OA I'm really sorry I'm definitely McKing that one up uh5 pounds who ask maybe two private question so you don't have to answer if you don't want to can you not apply for a Polish uh polish citizenship Ross I can but I need to learn a lot more polish I I'm up reading I'm aspiring to caveman level polish that's hey that's Miles Ahead compared to me okay I've got I've got French and English and then that's it uh polish it's not happening for me I'm afraid um this one is from Kyle Davidson from the United States $5 would games currently undergoing development be exempt from these laws what is the criteria for Grand farthering games in regards to this initiative it's entirely going to be up to the EU Commission on that we're gonna try to actually push a little higher than that and not open with that however again I can't speak for all the organizer members but I think a fair chunk of them agree with me though that we might be willing to compromise down to if that's the only way this passes will I would go for it because that would still be a lot of games lost but then it would save games in the future gotta okay uh and I'm going to go to another Super Chat from nishon from the US again5 speaking of NC soft Dev of Guild Wars so the developer of Guild Wars understood they actually opened up cities of Heroes playing with a few people it's better than zero 100% the although the the history behind that one's complicated I think even now I still don't know it but I think the end result is that they allow basically C the community to run their own licenses to host the game so oh hello has the sound cut well I'm here oh okay no it was just on my hands apologies for that um yeah okay so I've got yeah well it's funny that you mentioned that because I think we What wcross specifically if I remember there were you know there was the classic version that came out not too long ago and people were running those private servers to the best of my knowledge that's all illegitimate as far as the law goes and that's the result of leak code yeah and it was I am glad it exist just in case but I we're not endorsing that in any way in the initiative to like this is all about comp ends support yeah yeah that's another great point to mention none of this would affect any business practices whatsoever while the game was being supported so they could do companies continue could continue doing whatever they want the way they do now yeah it's only when they end support that this would factor in yeah because I I heard some people that were like talking about that and stuff and it's clear it's very important to make that distinction because you know that that caused a lot of um you know a lot of chaos back in the day yeah it was stumping them down left right and Center lots of controversies then they released the servers officially and you know everyone was very happy um this one we've got three more um but maybe more will come through you know mat Jetty gizzle asks again from America 499 for what it's worth as an American I wish Europeans would meddle more in our politics would probably be better off on consumer rights laws yeah potentially listen uh I think we've got enough problems here in the EU believe you know if you don't need more yeah we wouldn't be We can't agree on our own stuff okay so if we're gonna have to go to America and you know do stuff go it's gonna be a nightmare you know um oh yeah I should maybe mention part of the reason I have focused in so many different countries is I think if we have a major victory in one that if the market like say France or Australia and companies don't want to miss out on that market then they'll start coming up with their own end of life plans because again the cost can be very low to sell there and once they've already done that then they may as well release them globally once they do it and there is a precedence for this with in Australia uh they sued their Consumer Protection Agency sued valve for not allowing refunds and valve lost on that now globally you can get refunds on Steam from valve and that is the result of that so yeah that's the reason I'm focused so many different areas because I think all it takes is one big one for a win yeah it's funny that you mention it espec especially in the context of uh the EU there's this concept called um the Brussels effect where essentially um when the EU makes the law when the EU like passes something a lot of the time other countries outside will follow afterwards so you know it's kind of bigging up the EU themselves but there is some precedent to it where the EU is often the first want to do it and then people follow suit afterwards like in other countries right so you know there is historical precedent for for what you're talking about um Scout from TF2 with another $2 uh super chat if you go to the euq where the he suit a HV suit my preference I've done a series where voice Gordon Freeman oh I see of course that makes sense yeah I'm afraid I never played um never played halflife it was uh I think a little bit before my time unfortunately um Mr animator uh sent five US Dollars would you be willing to talk to Thor of pirate software to clear up anything he doesn't understand about stop killing games yeah I saw that there was a bit of a disagreement there I don't know if you you don't have to comment on that if you don't want to but no I can uh he's our most out spoken critic I've offered to talk to him but he said repeatedly he's not interested so I don't see the point in bothering him with it he has said he has said repeatedly uh there is no problem like this is not a problem so this is just a value Clash so again we're me and I think most members of the initiative we're in favor of any solution that solves the problem however if on his side he insists there is no problem that game are shut down this is as it should be and we should just learn to deal with it well I'm not sure how productive the conversation would be I mean I think a more productive conversation would be with a developer who has misgivings about this but they want to find a solution yeah that I think that would make much more sense someone who's open to discussion right I will if he wants but I'm not I see he said repeatedly doesn't want to I don't see the point in pushing it so fair enough you know everyone has their own point of view you know um I myself am for this initiative but I could definitely see people coming out saying hey we have this issue sort of thing always open to more discussion um we have a super chat from a WL 100 Che uh cck coruna if I'm checking that on Google right what if developers released official an official patch that would break the game while it was still in service and then claiming that the version they gave the players is the same that was supported I think that would fall under the malicious compliance or not fulfilling the requirements again because if it just truly breaks it and nobody can run it well that's the require yeah that that's actually another point that when we say people can run it we don't mean 100% of players so if somebody has a weird version of Windows or their Hardware is wrong but we're talking about like a reasonable expectation of course of so we're not asking him to fix every little problem we're asking him to not make it impossible and this is a fairly objective metric you know is it impossible to run the game bill that you've released if the answer is yes you're not in compliance you know yeah well it you know sorry to anyone who's trying to run like Red Dead Redemption 2 on a toaster or something but you'll not be covered by this it's got to be like minimum spec you know and then obviously uh it's like fully functioning um right well listen I think that we've come to just about the end of the stream here um if you guys have any final questions again send them through now also Smash Up the like button of course you know give the stream some love give the initiative some momentum you know everything is every little bit helps um but yeah is there anything that you wanted to to kind of close on Russ or you know address just I I really would emphasize that vital link thing I mentioned earlier where if you are bilingual or multilingual and you know a channel that talks about gaming in German or Spanish by all means try to get attention even small ones that I think that's the only way this works yeah the more that we get so well you're making great progress already you know so I think that you know keep it up that's what I would say you know it's h what you're doing right now I know that we still challenges ahead 1 million signatures is I see a lot of this as becoming more and more out of my my hands is the way I see yeah well hey that's what you know the citizens initiative is all about direct democracy that was the point of why they put it in and direct democracy can be pretty you know chaotic and messy at times that's the point you know so uh even if it gets a bit out of your hands yeah it's great but listen um I think we are going to call it here for the stream uh thank you so much Ross for joining oh I notic in the chat Paul from Chicago said I signed it well I hope Paul has an EU citizenship then your residence doesn't matter but your citizenship does so yeah do do not sign this if you are yes if you not an EU citizen so but if you are an EU citizen even if you live abroad you can sign this it's funny that you know because you mentioned that you know you're American yourself so you can't he says he does okay that's good okay great good stuff um but you said you're American yourself so you know you couldn't actually sign the petition I was in I was in a similar position with um the European elections so I have I'm Irish citizenship by well my wife can and her family and friends can so oh they they can vote on your behalf you know yeah yeah hey it all counts great no but um yeah I I couldn't actually vote in the European elections because I was not a resident of an EU country um so I kind of had to watch you know I was kind of pumping like guys go and vote go and vote go and vote and but I couldn't do it myself because you know there are certain laws depending for for the Irish it's very different you know um if you're not a resident you can't vote basically um so funny we are in similar positions got a final Super Chat I think um from AE um this is let me look up this currency because I actually don't know what this one is uh bellerian rubles so five bellerian rubles who says thank you n and Ross yeah definitely thank you Ross for for coming on it was a great chat sure thanks for having me on and talk about this no of course so honestly wish you the best of luck uh with this project you know it's close to my heart specifically but I'm sure there are plenty of people are here in the chat and you know out in the EU that would love to see this you know gain some momentum and it's no matter what the topic is it's always great to see people take part in EU democracy that's what the channel is kind of all about right getting people from all walks of life to to talk about it's in the eu's court now so very much so find out how it goes yeah you've kind of uh it's the first uh the spark that's gonna light the fire right um but yeah we'll see where it goes you know how how long ago did you start the initiative was it a couple weeks ago no no well okay I mean it opened a few weeks ago but we we were working on it late March we went to have it earlier but we found out we found out about it kind of late in the process ideally we we would have launched this with everything else back in April but yeah okay better late than never that's is always the case whenever you're doing a project like that youve basically like you know oh I'll start date will be April you could just add six months to that because you it's an amateur operation we've discovered a lot as we go yeah well it's a great experience as well you know for you yeah going through EU law that's the I don't want to be doing any of this I'd rather go back to the goofy videos I was talking about and not just are you obligated you're not thrilled by European Union law wow just more the campaigning or any of w i i can't possibly imagine why but yeah no it's been great thank you so much Ross um I also just want to give a quick shout out to uh ediot part of the EU Made Simple team he's been kind of running the show uh running the live stream and doing everything for us uh in the background you know working in the shadows making it all tick over so thank you very much Adia um but yeah thanks guys for for tuning in um bruss best of luck with the initiative and yeah uh I just want to shout out very quickly as
