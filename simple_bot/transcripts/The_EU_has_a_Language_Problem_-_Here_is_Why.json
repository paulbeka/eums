    "transcription": "the average EU unemployment rate is six percent but there's a large variance among the member states ranging from 2.2 percent in the Czech Republic to 12.7 percent in Spain if we look across the Atlantic things look very different the national unemployment rate is 3.5 ranging from two percent in Minnesota to 4.5 percent in Illinois so why is the difference among the U.S states so much smaller than the EU states to answer this question this video will explain the EU single Market how it compares to the US's labor market why the EU can't distribute slaver as effectively and what the EU can do about it the EU single Market grants us 27 members Four Freedoms free movement of goods free movement of capital free establishment of services and the free movement of workers this means that an EU National can seek employment in another EU member State without being discriminated against EU countries are not allowed to limit job offers to Nationals or require language skills that go beyond what is necessary for the dropping questions sounds great right well let's look at the states if someone can't find a job in San Francisco or even in all of California then he has a huge market right next to him the 49 other U.S states this Federal model is hugely beneficial as all 50 states have a common legal system currency and language now let's compare this to the 27 member states of the EU of whom 27 have a similar legal system 20 have the same currency and only a handful have the same language it is actually quite the opposite as the EU has 24 official languages this is the main reason why the union is inefficient at Job allocation as most jobs require the local language the result is high unemployment in the South even though we have employee shortages in the north so what can we do about it well the most straightforward solution will be to make English a second official language in every member State this wouldn't only help help the European Union with unemployment but would make everything easier obviously this is easier said than done and I feel it would require two phases a voluntary phase followed by a compulsory phase the EU would have to invest a lot of money into language courses throughout the union public institutions education and Health Care would need to be encouraged to use English as a second language and incentives need to be given to companies who adopt English as their official language the concept of English as a second language is not a new one China has been immensely successful in doing this as almost everyone speaks Mandarin plus their local language and given that English is already spoken by 370 million EU citizens it is the most logical language to adopt in my opinion a Common Language will help us remain competitive against both the US and China this does not mean we give away our local language but rather officially adopt a second one just like the Chinese did shout out to Carlos for helping me with this video and please subscribe if you like this sort of EU content until next time"
