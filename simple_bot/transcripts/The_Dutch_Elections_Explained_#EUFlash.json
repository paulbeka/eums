This \nchoice signals a significant political shift   in the Netherlands, aligning with the rising \ntide of right-wing populism across Europe. So, what do these results mean for the \nNetherlands and the EU? EU Flash will   give you the answers, delivered swiftly \nand simply. So make sure you subscribe. Before looking at results, how do \nthe Dutch elections actually work? In the Netherlands, the entire country acts \nas one single constituency. This means that when   Dutch citizens vote, they vote for a political \nparty rather than a local representative. The   share of the national vote a party receives is \ndirectly proportional to the number of seats it   gains in the 150-member parliament. This system \nallows for a wide representation of parties,   including smaller ones, as long as they \nreceive enough votes on a national level. So, who emerged victorious in the elections? The right-wing populist \"Party for Freedom \n(PVV)\" secured the most votes, winning 37 seats. In second, is the alliance between \nthe GreenLeft party and the Labour   party (PvdA & GL), who collectively won 25 seats. In third, the conservative-liberal \n\"People's Party for Freedom and   Democracy (VVD)\" who had the most seats in \nthe previous parliament, secured 24 seats. Remarkably, the \"New Social Contract (NSC),\" a \nparty just three months old, made a strong showing   with 20 seats, focusing on good governance, social \nsecurity and is against further EU integration. To establish a government in the Netherlands, \nforming a coalition is essential, typically   involving 3 to 4 parties to meet the 76-seat \nmajority requirement. Given the multitude of   parties and over 200 possible combinations, \npredicting the exact outcome is challenging. One potential scenario is the PVV, led by \nGeert Wilders, attempting to forge an alliance   with right-leaning parties. This coalition could \ncomprise the PVV, VVD (People's Party for Freedom   and Democracy), NSC (New Social Contract), and BBB \n(Farmer–Citizen Movement). Such an alliance would   command 88 seats in total, comfortably surpassing \nthe threshold needed to form a government.\" Nevertheless, Geert Wilders is known \nfor his history of far-right rhetoric,   marked by anti-Islamic and anti-immigration \nstances. He has previously advocated for   banning the Quran, Islamic schools, and \nmosques. Although Wilders has moderated   his rhetoric recently, his past statements may \nstill deter potential coalition partners. This   reluctance has already been voiced by \nthe leader of the New Social Contract,   who expressed reservations about working \nwith him even before the elections. Thus, there is a small chance \nof an alternative coalition,   bypassing the party with the most seats. \nHowever, such occurrences are rare,   with the most notable instance being in 1977. \nSince then, this scenario has not been repeated. So, what does this mean for the EU? Even though the European Union wasn't a \ncentral topic in the recent elections,   the winning party, PVV, has historically expressed \nscepticism towards the EU. Only a few years back,   they were actively advocating for 'NEXIT,' a \nDutch exit from the Union. While their stance   has somewhat softnened recently, a review of their \nlatest election manifesto reveals the following:   Reducing EU contributions & become \nnet receiver. No transfer of power   to the EU. Preserve all VETO rights. \nAnd no further expansion whatsoever However, these stances may change based \non their coalition partners. Nonetheless,   this result is not good news for those \nthat want further EU integration. My dear viewers, by December, we might see two \nnew Schengen Members, more updates on EU hopefuls,   and even a fresh trade deal with Latin \nAmerica. Want to stay on top of it all?
