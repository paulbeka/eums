    "transcription": "gentlemen welcome to another EMA simple live stream and it is a very exciting one today um as we're going to be talking about the largest topics with a very interesting guest but first I want to make sure that everyone can hear and see me uh without any issues so we don't run into problems later um if we could get just a confirmation in our live chat that would be grand audio and camera doing good that's always good to hear before we start I have three quick announcements the eagle eyed among you might have already seen that we are going to the uh European Parliament in Strasburg next week so be sure to keep your eyes open on that and one more thing we also have you see this camera it's it's let's say of questionable quality but that's going to be fixed very soon um I want to say this is the last stream with uh this weird old camera so that's good and then finally uh make sure to follow us on all of our socials if you haven't already I can hether uh I can neither hear nor see you OT but I may have drun a little too much on such a fine Wednesday okay well other people are saying they can hear me anyways right um ladies and gentlemen without further Ado I would like to introduce the guest of tonight Lucas mundle is a um MEP from the O in Austria U which is in the EP for those that don't know and also very interesting the president of the Spinelli group but my guest can introduce himself way better than I can so uh Mr mundle welcome to the show thanks for the invite thanks for having me so could you tell tell us a little bit about yourself um who who are you um what is it that you do what issues are the most important to you well I have been here in the European Parliament as a member from Austria as you already said since 2017 that means I'm the longest standing uh member of the European Parliament in the EP group from my country which is at the same time my constituency Austria is in its entirety one constit and uh I try to contribute to a Europe with more strength to the outside and more freedom to the inside so this is the overall claim for my stuff and me and this is uh the direction we go when it comes to our parliamentary contribution to the fate of our continent all right and that uh more unified approach towards the outside I guess manifests itself in the presidency of the Spinelli group could you talk a little bit more about what the Spinelli group is um and why you are engaged with this group The Spinelli group is a group of parliamentarians who want to contribute to a more Federal Europe it's also connected to the union of European Federalists Civil Society based uef is a French abbreviation spin group uh is very old already has been in place for many decades in the European Parliament uh it's also an honor to have the opportunity to chair the Spinelli group as a president for nine months so it's a rotation principle which I'm only uh let's say about to start with the first nine month after me uh colleagues from different uh other political groups will have this seat this chairmanship chairwoman actually and this is also part of the strength of Spinelli group that we are working cross border cross uh countries borders and uh especially cross uh borders of political affiliations political groups political parties uh for the sake of EU reform because this is what uh the meaning in today's political life of working for a more Federalist Europe is uh that we want EU reform EU reform means a new EU treaty uh as it was in the past we have already the year 2024 even nearly already 2025 uh that's not a new information but it might be new for the one or the other uh participant today that we have the longest period of time already passed without a new EU treaty we also have the longest uh period of time already passed without an excession uh but we had a brexit uh during this period of time so there are many good reasons uh also given the circumstances geopolitically there are many good reasons for encouraging and empowering whom the member states governments to be brave enough for a new EU treaty to show leadership in that regard responsibility responsibility includes uh the expression of to respond the response uh toward to the to the people's demand of EU reform and this is what we work together for as a Spinelli group in the European Parliament very clear and um like you said it's it's more almost a minus one instead of any session during that during that time so that is um regrettable especially for those that would like to see a a a stronger Europe um I want to move in uh move to our first in-depth topic which is of course um the us as we have just had the elections in the US and I was curious just to start off the conversation what is your first impressions on a uh Trump presidency for the EU as a l as as a as a large a larger project and specifically also for the idea of that federalism of that more integration unpredictability that's my first impression that's my first thought that's my first uh term uh expression I would associate uh with this election but I I I do not have any fear frankly uh I mean uh most important is that we know understand and emphasize the fact that we are Europeans we're not Americans we were not uh uh let's say uh we didn't have a duty to vote there it's not our president even while we are of course Very affected as the whole world is and especially we are very affected by who runs the administration of the United States this will be as of January Donald Trump fair enough we have to deal with it uh dealing with it means first of all transatlantic partnership will remain to be essential in the very literally meaning of essential for our security and for our economy so the question must never be whether or not there is a transatlantic partnership the question can only be how we will conduct this transatlantic partnership in the future in particular in this coming up next four years with Donald Trump again in place as the President of the United States secondly it will be a tough time uh Donald Trump sees himself as a deal maker I guess we are good in that uh I mean we are based on cooperation that's maybe not the first approach of Donald Trump to things but uh we conduct negotiations over the time we make compromises all the time compromise is uh also called the language of democracy and compromise is also what made Europe strong uh I would even dare to say made Europe great because Europe is great already and will remain great and that means we know how to negotiate we know how to make deals uh and the Trump Administration will uh recognize that we will be trustworthy partners and being able to make deals and uh if we will be approached toughly we will uh also be able to uh behave tough but uh we remain in this partnership because it's truly a partnership it's not any cooperation on the planet it's a partnership of the parts of the world who really contribute to the values Europe stands for like human dignity like individual freedom and others and uh this is at stake and this is not the funny part uh that uh these values have been attacked now for many years by systemic Rivals as they are called in the bureaucratic EU language and this is uh and this is why this partnership is essential for our but also for for the further development of humanity sure and is how exactly you already asked the question um not whether if that transatlantic relationship should be there um but how that transatlantic relationship should look like so um specifically how should that relationship look like and all by all of the elements it is very very clear that is an important relationship between the EU and the US especially when um things like authoritarianism are on the rise in our values you could say as um Europeans are being challenged challenged worldwide how should that transatlantic relationship look like and do you see any Futures with um maybe not from our side but from the US side of that relationship Falling Away first I very much believe in parliamentarism meaning also parliamentary diplomacy meaning also parliamentary ties especially between the US and the European Union uh meaning that uh especially now after the US election and as of January the Outreach I would let's say uh rather say the mutal Outreach but at least the Outreach we can control the Outreach from the European side to the colleagues uh on Capitol Hill in Washington DC in the Congress and the Senate will be more important than ever first parliamentary diplomacy parliamentary cooperation parliamentary Exchange day by day we did that in the past there were times we did more of it there were times we did less of it we have to do more than ever first secondly if the Trump Administration would even think about trade uh uh barriers uh I would not uh talk about the trade War this is already escalation in language I do not want to do that but if the Trump Administration would consider something like that we will consider the same okay uh as Sean Claude junker as a commission's president did uh during the first Trump Administration and uh I highly admire I don't know how he did it because it was a talk behind closed doors I would like to have been a fly on the wall in noal office that time but Sean CLA Juna actually as a commission's president avoided trade war between the strong and important uh the strong partners with an important partnership us and EU uh when security so economy is important security is important as well when uh Security will be made an issue from the US side uh I guess we have to uh strengthen ourselves continue to do so I would say the the serious part of this endeavor began with Putin Russia's War uh war of aggression with military means against Ukraine and hybrid means against all of us as we also should uh uh emphasize so uh we must help ourselves in Europe and we have also to convey to the US side of course when we work on our capability to defend ourselves it will always be complementary to Nato and not beside NATO not in parallel and of course by far note against NATO of course we know European Union more or less in its entirety is part of NATO NATO is nothing else but a security umbrella and insurance if you want to that's also the way I try to convey the message to constituents that uh I mean we need insurance is for many things I mean I hope your camera you were talking before in the beginning is Insurance very well but I mean I like the camera picture but maybe the next camera will provide an even better picture we have insurances we have insurances in place all the time in our daily life business life private life of course we need also an insurance against military risks isn't it so NATO is our security umbrella our insurance also as EU and EU will contribute uh ever more uh until or as long as it's necessary to Nato and this is also a message that say Trump Administration should not only receive but Embrace and with these two pillars economy and security and with the precondition of parliamentary exchange a lot uh will already uh be done for a good ground for a good relationship also during the Trump Administration ahead okay um that's clear and I would like to talk a little bit more about that security pillar um but before that I would like to address the Audience by saying um everyone that's watching feel free to leave your questions in the chat um if we can I will try and ask them the the more on topic the better um but let's move back to that security pillar because the first thing many thought of when uh Trump became president um was is that support for Ukraine going to be lasting and will the EU have to step up so to say spend more um take more of a leading role in providing this Aid to Ukraine what are your thoughts on on that maybe two things is uh to say before first I'm I do not want to be naive I try to remain realistic secondly uh I tend to see the glass half full uh that means support for Ukraine meaning for uh our freedom Liberty our civilization actually against this existential threat because Putin Russia's war is nothing but an existential threat um will remain yep secondly secondly I have to say I was a teenager when uh European leaders uh were emphasizing uh it will not happen again as it happened in the Balan Wars that we will need us support in order to sort things out and to calm things down and to find Solution on Europeans soil and around 30 years later we have a very similar situation we obviously are in need of us help to sort things out on European soil so uh this is the strongest uh reason for us to help ourselves as I have said before at the same time maybe that's the fourth pillar also when it comes to our Outreach to the Trump Administration I had talks about that already today in the European parliament in order not to talk only about parliamentary diplomacy but to do it I have to say maybe that's the fourth pillar uh that we have to connect the dots and the dots reach from pyang to Taran to Moscow to terrorist organizations of various kinds uh even to bku Haram on the African continent so there are ideologies of uh of hatred and destruction against our civilization and its very values and they are connected so uh we all know at least in his first Administration Trump was very keen to sort things out uh in the framework of our civilization of values in the Middle East and what what's today more revealed than ever is that there are connections uh in Daily Warfare in place between Taran and Moscow even supported by pyang and Taran is the same uh Source that's funding terrorism not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and in other parts of the world strongly connected to to terrorists also on the African continent also when it comes to funding so also the Trump Administration will know things are connected and uh if you if you let uh Putin win in Ukraine uh you will at the same same time also support Taran and if you let terrorism Prevail anywhere you will the other way around also support Putin Russia do we want that to happen I guess we do not want that to happen we are in this together and this is why there are reasons why I see the glass half full when it comes to us cooperation for our security all right well that makes a lot of sense and I would also agree I don't think we would like want that to happen um moving on then when we're talking about all of these things you've already mentioned quite a few Solutions um I would like to focus on the EU as a home when all of these things are connected when there's um this threat on our doorstep what is the answer and I'm I'm trying to hint a little bit here at the Spinelli group and the the topical Federation as is as it has been a big topic on our YouTube channel as well for the past few days so how could inte uh integrating European member states help or or assist in these large um security or other policy areas uh in the first place it's also about taxpayers money invested in security uh I mean when I talk about increasing our investment in security that doesn't necessarily mean in each and every case to spend more money in terms of numbers it also means to cooperate more to cooporate more when it comes to systems when it comes to exercise is uh when it comes to cooperation and this is what Pesco for example the So-Cal permanent structured cooperation of member states uh Armed Forces is about this is what our new very first in history defense commissioner of the European commission we will most probably elect in the European Parliament finally next week in the plenary session in Strasburg what this very first defense commissioner will be in the first place responsible for it to make these connections happen so this is one of the reasons why for our security integration is important also when it comes to hybrid threats uh we we have to face that the military Warfare uh in a conventional way is today not only anymore the only way of warfare but uh there are hybrid threats around there are even economic threats around and there is one attempt and maybe if if if one would have only one example in mind for what would be done uh to weaken Europe and to weaken our civilization then it would be division to cause division to cause division is what Putin Russia wants with violent bloody means to cause division is what terrorists want frankly to cause division is also what parts of the world want to try to cooperate with each member State specifically individually and not and dare or tend not to talk to the EU in its entirety but rather to have different economic outreaches to different member states so uh Unity also means here if you want to speak to Europe you really have to speak to Europe not to the one or the other member State for the sake of our own interests while I I'm happy to be Austrian and I will always remain Austrian I'm an Austrian Patriot as well as I'm a European Patriot that's no contradiction but I know the best thing for Austria that can happen is that we are part of a family which is so strong that uh each and every Power on Earth has to take into account uh the position of this this European integrated family and we will be a strong body uh to talk to and this is also true for large powers like China and others you make a an interesting point of um of unity and the topic that really fascinates me is that definitely not everyone sees it this way uh I believe you can agree with me on that that um closer EU integration is still a topic that many don't agree or don't see the vision of or yet or or not at all I'm curious what you would say to let's say convince the uh average person in the benefits of of this um closer integration this closer cooperation and what you just gave was a very technical answer so I'm going to try and challenge you to give it easy as possible answer as you can you refer uh to uh our own responsibility in this whole Endeavor and here I'm very critical on bureaucracy over bureaucracy and things alike I I want to quote monq uh I hope it's simple enough mon said I really I I I really hope so it's not ironically meant mon said if it's not necessary to make a law what would then be necessary mon said when it's not necessary to make a law it is necessary to not make a law meaning to avoid a regulation to avoid an extra regulation and sometimes in this parliamentary procedure in this parliamentary uh Endeavor not only European Parliament in each Parliament on Earth it's even uh more difficult it needs even more efforts to avoid making a law than to actually make a law so uh we have to reduce bureaucracy we have to reduce regulation we have to reduce bureaucratic burden for for companies for small and middle-sized Enterprises for each and everybody I mean we are talking today about the big threats for our security we're talking about the big opportunities also for economy when it comes to us connection and connections all over the world today in this channel half an hour ago before we started our talk today I have received an email message from a mayor in my home country in Austria in my constituency the mayor is also a friend and he confronted me not with security issues or global economy issues he confronted me with some new EU regulation I wasn't even aware of yet about wires I mean uh let's see uh I will have a deeper look into that and he's concerned he's concerned he's even more than concerned he's critical uh and uh people tend also to become cynical when it comes to regulation they don't they don't want to have in place and if they want to have them in place or they could accept them then they want to have them on Regional level or local level uh but not centralistic U decided on from EU level and this is our part in it I have to say that if we will not we will we will even cause division within EU uh and play the game of those who want to weaken Europe uh if we confront people with too much bureaucratic burden there's really a lot at stake all right so um only make laws when they're necessary and at the level that they're required to be I mean I I believe that's quite a clear message I want to turn to our live chat for a minute because we have a viewer um user Villa asks and it's a bit off the topic so I'm I'm hope you're okay with that um since mundel is also an EP MP I want to ask his opinion on EP stance on EU integration EP is largest EU group but only makes up 15% of the Spinelli group while snd makes up almost 48% of it so what is the EP stance on the Spinelli group and deeper EU integration well uh EP is not only the largest group it's of course uh due to that also the most diverse group so you will of course find uh or I will find maybe one EP colleague who would uh uh not uh join me when I say the one or the other opinion but generally I mean I'm I'm happy to be part of EP EP is the Christian Democratic group European integration is uh in its iety aan Democratic vision from 80 years before uh Claus V the long-term Secretary General of the European Parliament who had his roots also in Christian democracy one St Christian democracy only had three ideas uh in 80 years of existence uh first EU integration second transatlantic partnership third ecosocial uh market economy so this is of course a bit ironic because it's more than three ideas but it's three big pillars three big visions and of course EP is not the only driving force I would never say that I have here Social Democratic colleagues liberal colleagues and others who whom I highly highly appreciate in their parliamentary Endeavor and their contribution to EU reform but uh I guess EU uh I want to say EP actually is right in seeing itself in the very core of EU reform and this is also true for the values uh and the vision of this Pinelli group okay wonderful um since we are nearing the end of our uh conversation I wanted to ask you um a question about what other major issues do you see I feel like um maybe myself or other people the media might be very captured on certain specific topics or or issues um that are being framed as very important and they might very well be but I'm curious is there anything that you want to bring attention to that you've not been seeing enough in the media or or anywhere or just being talked about in general maybe two things uh which uh spontaneously come on my mind the one is messenger services why do I say that uh sometimes uh let's say regular uh political um op ads media journalists as well as politicians from centered political groups no matter on what level some sometimes they are still surprised about the one or the other election result because uh it seemed to be differently before the election day and then there is a result which tends to more populism than expected I want to draw the attention on the fact that what's happening in some messenger services channels is by nature not to be seen from outside it's by Nature not public but it affects hundreds of thousands of people and Europe VI millions of people so populistic extremist harmful political Powers maybe ones who would be sponsored from outside the EU in order to divide us and we talked about division today might use these Shadows of nonpublic communication in uh messenger uh channels uh in order to cause distraction and to cause this kind of division we should be aware of that I'm sure most of the the viewers today uh and uh the viewers generally of you made simple of this beautiful channel will be uh uh let's say interested in a positive United uh future with freedom and dignity uh we should be aware of that and we should do our best in order to make the physical encounter the personal encounter the face-to-face talk to as much people as we can and also to react to positions and opinions we might not share at all but even then it will be more important to react in the framework of a broader diverse positive uh and and uh and Liberty based society secondly very different topic but since you said what do you think it's not covered enough in the media it's the sahil region it's sub Sahara Africa because it's clear the crisis that affects us most because it's existential it's an existential poal threat as said before is Putin Russia's War uh the crisis that also affects us a lot because nothing that happens in the Middle East uh is contained in the Middle East it's very relevant for our daily life is uh the the terrorist war against Israel and the defense of Israel uh for uh its uh very existence and for its people but one crisis we are not uh too aware of is the one in the sahil region subsaharan Africa which is a severe crisis uh until up to nutrition issues which are extremely harmful for people causing not only migration but also uh conflict also violence uh and this is also something we will be affected of so for the sake of you of uh of of human dignity we have to help but also for the sake of our own interest we have to be aware and we have to help also there yeah no absolutely I I believe the Sahel region could uh deserve its own entire video live stream everything because it's such a such a complicated topic but um as we're at the end of our time I wanted to give you one last opportunity to um give a a final message or a final idea to the viewers before you head off so so any shout outs even that you would like to do uh go ahead the floor is yours thank you for this one last chance as you just call it I like it very much and I dare to say parliamentary m is always part of the solution that's what I want to share parliamentarism is part of the solution parliamentarism is one of the biggest Innovations of mankind I mean you would think electricity would be would be a big innovation or or printing books would be a big innovation which is all all all true but also parliamentarism is a big innovation because it means people are represented and not only affected but also represented and decisions would be taken not with violence not at all but with talking to each other and with deciding democratically and with the chance for everybody to newly elect uh every few years and this is why I I advocate for parliamentarism as uh as a big innovation and as an idea which will contribute to Solutions also in the future I believe that's a wonderful message what at least I personally can totally stand behind Lucas mundle thank you very much for joining us tonight the audience thank you very much for joining as well and uh we will see each other or not us but me and the audience will see each other again in Strasburg and um if that's all then have a lovely evening everyone everyone's saying great guests as well by the way so they they definitely enjoyed your your time here all right bye-bye"
