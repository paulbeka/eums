    "transcription": "The most fascinating European election result was \nin France. Just an hour after the results came in,   President Macron called for a general \nelection later this month. Wow - no one   saw that coming! But wait. Let’s backtrack \na bit to understand what’s going on. France is the second-largest country \nin Europe and sends 81 politicians   to the EU Parliament. The only country \nto send more is Germany, who sends 96. But let's dive into the results. Le \nPen’s and Bardella's National Rally   crushed the competition, winning \n30 seats—7 more than last time! Far behind Le Pen is the “Need for Europe” \ncoalition, which includes Macron’s Centre   Renaissance party and his allies, winning just \n13 seats. That’s around 10 fewer seats than   last time and less than half of what Le Pen \nsecured. Which is quite extraordinary really. In third place, we have the \nSocialist and Democratic coalition,   “Wake up Europe,” which includes the \nSocialist Party. They got 13 seats,   up by 7 from last time. La France Insoumise, \nrepresenting the left, got 9 seats, a 3-seat gain. The center-right Les Républicains managed to \nget 6 seats, a decrease of 2 seats from last   time. The “Proud France” coalition, which \nincludes Reconquest! and other parties,   earned 5 seats. And lastly, the Green Ecologists \nsecured 5 seats, a decrease of 8 seats. So, what does this mean on a European level? In the European Parliament, there are \nseven main political groups. French   parties align with these groups and work \nwith counterparts from other nations. Now,   here are the overall results for each of \nthese groups, this includes all the votes   throughout Europe. And now, because I am \nsure that would be your next question,   here are the changes, so increases and \ndecreases, to the previous parliament. Now let's look at the French influence. The \nmajority of French seats are now going to   the I&D group, with Le Pen’s National Rally \nbeing a major player there. Lets also have   a look at all the other parties. And \ndo you see the elephant in the room? Well it is Renew Europe who is the \nbiggest loser of the night. Macron,   a significant voice within Renew Europe, lost \nmany seats, leading to a major setback. This loss   was so severe that he called for a general \nelection right after the results were in! This upcoming election is legislative,   not presidential, meaning the parliament \nand the prime minister will be elected. Was this a knee-jerk reaction? No way. Polls \nhad shown for months that Le Pen was likely   to win big. Macron saw this coming and \nlikely has a plan. But what is this plan? Well we see 2 possibilities. He Thinks He Can Win:\nBy calling snap elections,   Macron might be aiming to catch opposition \nparties off guard, giving them less time   to organise. He could be betting on a better \nturnout in a national election to benefit him,   although polls would suggest otherwise. \nSnap elections could also compel a coalition   to block the rise of the far-right. For \ninstance, Les Républicains had previously   refused to join forces, but this tactic \nmight pressure them into reconsidering. He Wants Le Pen to Win:\nThe more intriguing theory is that Macron   wants Le Pen and the National Rally to gain power \nnow, hoping they become unpopular before the 2027   presidential election. This is not unheard of, \nas most French parties that gain power tend to   lose a lot of support once they are in control. \nAdditionally, Macron will retain control over   foreign policy and defence, which are presidential \ntasks. While Macron cannot run again in 2027,   he might want to ensure his political party's \nsurvival on both the national and EU levels. But what do you think?
