not usual uh time normally we will be streaming a little later uh but still glad that everyone is here uh you seem a bit bright though yeah that's that could be the case the the sun is shining straight through the window um let's see okay I believe everything is working so um then without further Ado ladies and gentlemen um welcome to the live stream uh it is great to have you all here um as always make sure to follow us on our social media like Instagram and Twitter um or X's it's also known as but no one likes to call it as X um if you really want to support us patreon is in the description and um many people don't know but we also have a Discord uh so if you want to discuss anything EU want to debate about the topics please make sure to join that as well um so today what I have for you guys in store is a very exciting guest um today we have Peter uh Peter stano and he will correct me uh if the pronunciation is supposed to be different um but he is the EU spokesman for foreign policy so uh very knowledgeable about everything that is to do with the EU um and especially to the outside world um but next to that also part security policy um let's see some some people are qu asking are you on Macedon no we are not unfortunately but um without further without further Ado uh I would like to welcome Peter stano Peter welcome thank you for joining us joining us hi hi bonjour G I have to use all the working languages that we are uh using in the in the European Union it's it's great pleasure to to be here and thank you very much for having me here I'm I'm ready to tackle all the questions related to EU foreign policy the pleasure is all mine I'm just going to look at the chat real quick to see if the audio is working for you as well so that we we know that everyone can hear you too um which I believe everyone can um so in the meantime Peter I would like to um well first of all ask you can you introduce yourself um who are you um what is your work um just a a quick introduction I think everyone is very curious okay you introduced me correctly my name is Peter stano or if you want Peter stano because I'm originally Slovak but I don't mind the English version of the of the pronunciation of my name and I'm the spokesperson of the European uh Union for foreign policy which includes also security and defense policy so this means my role is to explain to the media who then explain to the audiences at home to people like you to explain to the media why the EU is doing stuff in relations to other countries outside of the EU what are we doing what are our positions our actions what do we think about uh developments around the world and what are we doing in order to protect the interests of the EU outside of the EU okay very cool um extremely interesting but um before we dive into the um let's say topics of today the the the breaking news um I I I'm I'm very curious uh how the your office actually works because um I I think many uh including myself might be a little bit confused because I I believe that most foreign policy lay with the EU member states themselves eles um and not necessarily with the EU so um could you maybe explain a bit what like what the exact tasks are of your office and um maybe a bit more about that um let's say mismatching my own information absolutely and with pleasure because I I I understand that it might be difficult for people just simply to imagine how it works exactly because as you said foreign policy defense policy and security policies these are policies which are uh so-called National competence that means that all decisions uh in these three areas are being made by member states in unanimity unanimity means that everyone has to agree no one can be against but of course we have 27 member states and soon probably more and all this needs to be coordinated prepared facilitated and this is the role of EU foreign policy which is headed by the EU High representative for uh foreign policy and security policy currently is Jose Borel but you know that the Mandate of the current institutions will expire in few month months but still regardless of the name the role of the high representative is to coordinate strengthen and move ahead or Advance the the foreign policy of the of the European Union so that we are able as a community of relatively many member states very diverse so that we are able to act and speak with one voice when it comes to International stage so that we are able to react fast to say something what we think about events uh around us but also to act fast so that we can let's say protect the European Union protect the European citizens contribute to to the solutions of of various crisis in our neighborhood which are destabilizing us uh as well so so it's a role of the Hub coordinator facilitator and the one who tries to find the consensus among the member states because 27 you know like I don't know how many people are now connected but if we start to discuss one topic we will have 27 different views or 30 different views or 100 different views and to find the common ground is very difficult but this is how the EU works we find the consensus because together we are stronger and we if we agree on something on a solution then the solution is powerful and sustainable because it's backed by 27 member states uh and this goes not only for the foreign policy but of course like I can speak only about foreign policy because this is where I have the best insight and this is what uh what I try to explain to media from all over the world who are more and more interested what the EU thinks and what the EU does about various problems on this Beau beautiful planet beautiful planet well um it's so if I'm hearing it correctly um it's not only looking outside of the European Union but also a lot of getting every single member state to um Point their no their proverbial noses towards the same direction so a lot of coordination uh and speaking with the member states as well um which I can imagine is not not an easy task I can imagine it's it's not easy but again I mean it's 27 very different member states and if you take if you look at the map of the European Union we have countries as different as Portugal on the westernmost end of the EU and Estonia at the eastern and northernmost end of the EU and then the scandin countries each of them have different history different links with neighbors different experiences different social fabric so different mentality and it's already a miracle that we that we manage actually not only to be together to live together but work efficiently together in so many areas including the foreign and defense policy and nowhere else is this scen better than on the case of Ukraine the biggest security Challenge and threat for the EU and yet we manag to be unified and United right from the start in in our response to this to this aggression and that goes for many other things so yeah it's difficult it's complicated but it works and this is the only way how the EU can work yeah I I want to get into topics like Ukraine in just a moment uh because that is obviously very pressing and and a very big topic uh especially for many Europeans today um let me turn to the to the chat real quick because I see a few questions already uh so thank you for those uh one once again if you want your question answered 100% uh please make sure to use the Super Chat function so not only your chat will be answered but also you can support our channel in the work that we do uh so Deon asks um early today the EU didn't come to an agreement with Chinese car manufactures what could happen now since there was no deal and this is already moving towards the um let's say substance of of what we're going to be talking about but maybe uh you could you have you have a thought or something to say about that uh Peter the issue of electric cars and our economic relations with China are not really part of the foreign policy so this is not my competence but in general the approach of the EU to any issues we have with our partners and China is still a partner of the European Union trading partner economic partner but also political partner because we work with China closely for example on uh on climate change so the the general approach of the EU is engagement because the EU believes in win-win Solutions we don't impos things we protect our interest but we also take into account the interests of others and we try to discuss so the same thing as I explained before how we arrive to to to compromises within the EU we try to apply also in in interactions with Partners so if we have a grievance with China with us with African countries with anyone we try to engage in a dialogue to see how we can settle the issue so that both of us profit because in the end if we profit our citizens profit from it and if the Chinese profit in this case their citizens profit so everyone is happy so we don't really see by default confrontation as the way forward we always tried to engage and if we see that the partner is not ready then of course then we take the necessary measures legal measures which are you know justified in our in our legal uh framework then we take the necessary measures to protect ourselves uh to stick to the laws to stick to the rules but again we start from the premise of finding solution agreeable for everyone beneficial for every everyone and uh and this is what we are trying to advance also in the case of the electric cars and the issues we have uh in China in this in this specific trade issue okay um so thank you for all your questions guys they're they're all very interesting but I want to ask one more question as a sort of introductory qu uh introductionary question before we move on um could you explain very shortly how the um the you already mentioned borell which is I believe going to be replaced by kayak kalas in a few months um how is the that high representative related to um to your office to the to your team is that the could we say that it's the boss or is that the um the highest representative could you say a little bit about that I will reveal um a few details from our internal quisine so of course Among Us within our team we refer to hrvp as the boss but um in Brussels in the setup of the European institutions everything is a little bit more complicated so the full title of Jose Borel or uh in few months k is hrvp high representativ SL vice president High representative goes for the foreign policy High representative of the EU foreign policy which means on behalf of EU member states at the same time it's vice president of the commission so it's double-headed position so he sits in the European commission but also in the European external Action Service which is the spe spe Specialized Service if you want the Diplomatic arm of the European Union uh which serves the the member states in the field of foreign policy our team as a press team for the foreign policy is sitting in the European Commission in the structure we belong to the European commission to the director General general for communications but paradoxically we speak on behalf of the high representative Borel that means on behalf of the EU foreign policy which is agreed by the member state so it's a little bit specific and for the Nerds of European integration and European Poli is it might be very exciting and very interesting to get more insights about this uh for people outside it doesn't really make sense because what we say we say on behalf of the EU foreign policy which is represented by borell or then by kalas and formed decided adopted uh by the member states so it's relatively easy but of course he is not part of our team High representative is not sitting in our offices we are physically also um uh in different places but our role is to explain what he does on behalf of the EU okay okay thank you of course it's the EU so it can't be just straightforward and easy uh that wouldn't make it fun otherwise um thank you for your comment V hello Peter hello Elliot thank you for your work in making the EU more comprehensive to its citizens just a uh a nice comment um so moving on to the let's say more substance um because that's why everyone's here um I think I think it would be interesting to uh take the different parts of the world that the EU um interacts with so let's say the different continents um and then go from the the the current topics from continents so let's let's say we begin with um Europe but the non-european countries um could you maybe say a little bit about what the main tasks um include when it comes to uh interacting with non-european um me not let's say European non-eu members um and what do we think about here is this like um security cooperation sanctions uh of course Ukraine is in that same um basket uh but Belarus and Russia as well um Georgia all of these countries could you could you say a little bit more about that yes as you said Elliot previously it's a lot of fun here and even in your question I can reveal that there is also a lot of fun because non-eu members in Europe actually have two levels those who don't want to be in the EU and those who want to be in the EU so we have countries like Norway UK Switzerland which are countries very closely linked to to the European Union but they are not members yeah but they are working with us on many issues we have specific agreements with them for example Switzerland is part of shenen Norway I think as well Norway actually is taking over almost 90% of the European legislation so they are aligned with the European Union to to very very high extent and then we have countries in Europe who want to join the European Union these are what we call accession countries in the western Balkans so countries like Serbia bosnan heroina Montenegro North Mac onia Kosovo and countries in our Eastern neighborhood countries like Ukraine also candidate country of the EU because Ukraine wants to join the EU and is in the process of uh negotiating the entry uh mova and Ukraine oh sorry Moldova and Georgia and then we have Armenia aeran Belarus of course with Belarus we have no we have almost no contacts because there is a dictatorship which stole elections from people four years ago which is participating in the illegal aggression by Russia against Ukraine so of course our contacts there and our aims there are very limited and the only aim is to uh basically have lukashenko step down and have democratic transition in the country but we know that this is not going happen anytime soon but hopefully the belorussians will be able to achieve it at one point and we are supporting them but we are not um organization involved in regime change so that's why we are supporting people but we are not going in changing the regimes this is you know not what we do in case of aeran of course I mean again different model of governing the society but we have a lot of economic cooperation we are bound by the cooperation partnership agreement where we are developing mutually beneficial um uh contacts and ties okay in an extent that corresponds to the Ambitions of the partner they don't want to have much with the EU so we don't do much Armenia on the contrary wants to get as close to the EU as possible to develop the cooperation as much as possible so we then respond to them based on the level of their ambition and we develop closer cooperation so and our main aim is to share the EU experience and the best things about the EU and that means stability and prosperity for the citizens so that people can live decent lives in secure and stable environment so is this only um messaging that the that that your office does or does your Al office also assist in um the countries that are in assession talks like mova Ukraine or is that more towards the I believe there's also an enlargement uh commission right so is are you also partly responsible for that or is there a clear split between between those two maybe a little clarification on the terminology when we say our office our office means the Press Office of the higher representative or the Press office for the foreign policy so we explain the policies those who actually do the policies and our colleagues the so-called eurocrats if you want official experts diplomats in different we call them Services of the European commission or of the European Union in case of foreign policy it's the external Action Service of the EU called EAS in case of commission there are directorates General these are like Ministries for example and exactly as you as you remarked the enlargement and also the neighborhood policies are Advanced first of all through directorate general for enlargement and neighborhood policy it's called abbreviated DG near they have all the money they have all the expertise and they are doing the everyday work to help the partner countries for example to conduct the necessary reforms to get closer to the European standards or to take over the European legislation depending on the level of how close they want to be with us uh to support them withi with financial assistance so this is the role of the of the DG near so the technical work on bringing the European standards to that country and then the EAS as so-called foreign Ministry of the EU we oversee the more political factors let's say the the security factors the the overall cooperation as you remarked the alignment with European sanctions because countries who are applying to join the European Union have already now the obligation to adopt uh the sanctions decisions we are taking against other countries or against other entities around the world they need to we call it align with EU foreign policy so so the the EAS EAS is overseeing this and is giving more political um political oversight on what the colleagues from Individual specialized dgs are doing on the ground let's say on a more technical level uh in the accession process or in uh bringing the the the agreements we have with the neighboring countries uh closer to the European standards and closer to the delivery of the results because in the end what we want to see at the end of all these efforts working with those countries is practical benefits for the citizens so they see their country is reformed their econom is running the level in of investment from the EU Rising exchanges between us not only trade exchang exchanges exchanges of students People to People contact growing and bringing us together because this is the soft power of the EU we are exporting a model of principles and values and we do it through this through this I think way which is really beneficial for everyone in to those values we will we will return um shortly uh first I want to ask a few questions because some people in the chat are wondering some uh some question have some questions uh country specific questions excuse me um Villa thank you for being a patron he asks what is the eu's official stance on what is happening in Georgia right now which I believe that they are referring to um the new Russia law as it has been introduced and the um and the effects of such uh and are are there any aspirations for Georgia accession to the EU or has that has that been abandoned as a realistic objective we just established that this is more for DG near but perhaps you have a have a view on that as well of course Georgia is it's a very s story unfortunately uh not Georgia as a country but uh the actions of the current government yes because on one hand last year there they they submitted the application to join the European Union but in practice and they and they declared that their strategic objective is to join the European Union but what they do in practice is not really to come closer to the EU but they are taking the country away from the European track away from the European values and it's not only the latest law which is so-called protection of the family law which is really uh a law against lgbti y but uh earlier this year they adopted another Russian inspired law law or so-called law on the transparency of the foreign foreign funding or foreign influence and all these laws although they are branded as something that sounds quite legitimate and good because every country need to protect itself in the essence these laws are against the principles and values of a Democratic Society they are against the European standards and principles for two or three reasons one is that usually they are adopted in a procedure which is either rushed not completed and without public consultations like the case of the of the latest uh batch of the of the legislation last week on the on the so-called family protection or like in case of the of the law on the foreign uh on transparency law on the foreign funding completely against the advice of everyone the European Union the United States the the Venice commission Venice commission is an independent body which is a benchmark for all the legislative steps in Europe and now when everyone says the law is not really good and it goes against the basic principles and yet they they adopted it the president was against it big majority of the population was against it the Georgian government promised last year after massive protest that they will not bring this law on the table yet they did it in Spring this year again so they lied and they are introducing something which is against the advice of every friend of Georgia from from wide and far so this is taking the country away from the European ambition because for European uh process to start we identified nine priorities so before that they had like certain priorities and with one law they are they are violating already three of these priorities or not delivering on them so it's very difficult it's a set story we don't abandon Georgia and Georgian people we know that 80% of Georgian people want to go closer to the Europe but the curent government despite what they Proclaim indeed is taking the country unfortunately away from Europe and the big big decision moment will be the October elections yeah that's what I was about to say there's going to be very important elections in October because essentially if 80% um want to pursue more closer ties to the European Union and their government government seems to be taking them away from it um in an ideal world you would hope that then the government would change uh so we will see in the in the elections um but definitely something to keep your eye out on um before we move to uh Ukraine which I believe is probably one of the the largest topics within uh Europe right now um I wanted to ask a question from one of our viewers called Daman he asks um UK citizens have pulled 60 uh roughly 60% for rejoining the EU do you think there could be any time within the next decade or two of the UK rejoining and what would the UK need to agree to to rejoin this is the Eternal question can and will the EU the UK rejoin the EU um I guess yeah do you have a do you have an answer of course no certainly not in the next two or three months when the current institutions will be still in place so our mandate is to talk on behalf of the EU until the end of this mandate this will expire in November or December so for sure in these next few months it's absolutely it will not be on the table so anything beyond that I can give you only my personal view which is not really relevant but again joining the EU is a process where the population of a country in question needs to agree and we have we have seen the referendum few years ago about the brexit yeah if Britain organizes another referendum and the overwhelming majority of people says yes we want to join the EU then okay it will be an ni signal it will be for the remaining uh for the members of the European Union to decide because accession is actually also something all 27 member states of the EU have to agree with Y and after the very very traumatic experience with the with the post brexit negotiations behavior and everything that was happening in the relations between the EU and and and UK I'm not really sure the member states um are really inclined to go through this in a reverse mode again but again things are changing very fast in in the world today we in the EU believe that together we are stronger so we are we have the integration in our DNA in our blood so of course we think that we will be stronger if we have more members but again every member potential member has specific circumstances but again here the most important thing is the will of the population the voters in the country question and then the willingness of the EU to to receive such a country the members that's that's always the biggest part is we are we will never be sure if uh if people want theuk back in the first place um but we'll see uh so they're moving on um I believe that many in Europe see Russia um or maybe saw as their biggest threat uh especially after the Russian Uh Russian invasion into Ukraine and I was wondering what your um it's difficult for me to to ask let's say experience or uh does the your office have anything to do have um any um task within the current sanctions on Russia within the current um uh talks with with with countries surrounding Russia anything to do with Russia uh basically yes of course I mean uh Russia launched uh illegal aggression against Ukraine with this Russia violated un Charter international law its own commitment Russia violated its own commitments and Russia has shown to to everyone in the world that they don't hesitate to use military force when they try to advance their interests and recreate some kind of Neo imperialistic sphere of influence as Putin is dreaming but uh what what Russia is doing they are not only militarily attacking Ukraine they are also leading an infow War information war against Ukraine of course but against the European Union as well against the United States against everyone who does not agree with their illegal behavior and of course it affects us and we are fighting back so in our case our team for example we people involved in communication we have to deal every day with the the banking the Russian lies the Russian information manipulation the Russian disinformation sorry yeah sorry to interrupt you I think that's this is a very interesting topic because I believe this has been going on this hybrid Warfare uh so to speak has been going on for quite many years but um have you seen an uptick or has there been an increase in this activity ever since the war in Ukraine of course of course of course I mean Russia was using information manipulation since many years already but in the EU collectively we started to um uh to perceive it and we realized that they are using it against us in 2014 when they attacked Ukraine for the first time when they illegally annexed Crimea and started the terrorist separatist war in the east of Ukraine and then we realized aha this is not a military operation only it's accompanied by a massive disinformation campign campaign directed also against us against individual member states of the EU and then since then of course there were ups and downs of course Corona crisis uh marked a very different category of disinformation when all the Russian disinformation actors focused on disinformation activities related to Corona and trying to undermine the EU from within through thisinformation related to Corona but then shortly before the aggression against Ukraine started in February two years ago uh we've seen already the preparations so they were preparing ground as of December January it was so obvious that they are preparing the ground and then of course it massively went up and since then it's it's doubling it's tripling because it's it's really a massive onslaught of disinformation accompanying the military activities and accompanying every developments on the on the field uh with various disinformation campaigns various narratives we can go into it in detail if you want but yes in in short there was an upti and it continues because they are using it as another way of attacking Ukraine and the EU yeah and I believe it is uh well in my personal opinion sometimes rather effective as well um but yeah this is obviously uh not the this info even though it's it's an incredibly interesting topic um I would like to move on to other parts of the world so we've covered uh non-eu European um countries um but let's move on to probably um another very very uh difficult Topic at least for myself uh because many emotions go pared to it and paed with it and you probably can already guess it uh we're moving more towards the Middle East the current um War conflict uh between uh Israel and pal Palestine right and there's many people in the chat um that have been quite vocal already um asking let's say thought-provoking questions like um is supporting genocide also our values as the European Union um so they're very outspoken so could you um give us the the current stance of the the European uh Union on the current conflict in Gaza absolutely and I I absolutely agree I mean this is an issue that stimulates a lot of emotions because we see human suffering on a scale unseen until now I mean okay we've seen the massacr going on in Syria we've seen also the the stuff what is going on in in in Ukraine but what happens in UK in in Gaza is really something concentrated on a very small territory from which the people have actually no escape and this is the tragic about it and yes we are very much aware about all the criticism against the European Union when it comes to to this conflict but um again politically I have to recall the official positions of the European Union as agreed by the European leaders we said very clearly three main things we totally rejected and condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas who actually triggered this Hamas knew what Israeli response would be so we re we we we strongly condemned the terrorist attacks from 7th of October last year we said Israel has rights to defend itself because Israel was attacked and was under attacked and by the way until today there are Rockets flying against Israel so Israel continues to be under attack but then we said of course we need to be very careful when it comes to the proportionality of the response and that's why we said Israel has the right to defend itself in line with the international law and you see that there are more and more cases where it's really difficult to see if the international law is being respected one thing is that there is no access to Gaza barely no one has uh I mean almost no one has access to Gaza so that's that's problem number one problem number two way too many people have been killed maimed injured traumatized their Futures destroyed and they are without the necessary means to survive polio broke out in Gaza after 20 years so it's it's it's heartbreaking from a human level it's heartbreaking from political level we still have two parties continuing the fight as long as there are two parties still fighting the war will going will be going on and people will be suffering eu's position is very clear you can of course ask legitimately so why does the EU don't don't stop the war doesn't stop the war well do we have means we try uh through diplomatic means we try but Israel has Partners who are holding his back very strongly and they listen only to them sometimes not even to them and that's the United States so we try to pressure Israel we try to pressure the the Palestinian uh side we don't pressure Hamas because we don't have official contacts with Hamas but we are ping the partners of of Hamas countries like Qatar Iran to make sure to them that they are responsible for this widescale suffering it's a very emotional issue it's a very divisive issue The credibility of the EU went down especially in the Arab world because of the perceived double standards or in inability to act but I I would like to ask everyone try to believe that at least from the European level we are really or the politicians the diplomats are trying to do whatever they can but in order to stop the war you need to have the two parties being willing to stop the war and they are not neither Hamas nor Israel at this stage and other actors involved like hisbah Iran and and the huis in Yemen I I I think that's a very good point and I can't imagine it must be easy especially when within the European Union the member states also have different opinions on the conflict themselves so it must be almost near to impossible to get one uh aligned view out on on this uh conflict as well um true but again the basic position of the EU was agreed by 27 member states so we insist on these three points right to self-defense hostages needs to be released humanitarian access need to be granted Israel needs to act in line with the international law where we don't agree is in how far should we go to make sure that Israel really sticks uh to respecting the international law and how to ensure the accountability for any possible violations of the of the international LA and there is the unanimity of the member states which in case of Israel is not there unfortunately yeah uh so Peter from one divisive topic let's go to the next because there's no lack of divisive topics within uh everything surrounding the European Union um wayam imim too says or asks what is the eu's stance towards Taliban and Assad regimes now that anti-immigrant sentiment and calls for deportation are arising so from uh Israel and Palestine to immigration of course a very large subject right now what are your thoughts on that it's three very relevant and animportant issues I would say not really related because um the level of our engagement or lack of Engagement with with someone or something in case of Taliban uh does not really uh influence our migration policies because migration policies are mostly about who do we allow into the EU territory under what conditions but with Taliban we don't recognize Taliban they took over militarily the the power in Afghanistan so they are not elected they don't have legitimacy in our eyes but they are in power so we consider them as de facto authorities and we have the necessary contacts with them in order to be able to help the Afghan people we cannot cut the contacts we are actually on the ground the EU delegation is the only Western Embassy present in Afghanistan thanks to our thanks to our presence on the ground we are able to continue helping Afghan women for example to get education to get the humanitarian assistance to people who who need it but we so we need to we need to be realistic you know cutting ourselves off from someone will not allow us to achieve anything and then we will be just watching from the second from the from the seat behind so we prefer to be on the ground engage and conveying them also our dis pleasure with what they do and we are there they tolerate us and we are able to achieve small things for the people of course you could say and there could be big discussions about like in how far should we stand up for the values but this is what we believe is the most effective way if you want to help the people same in Syria I mean we don't recognize the legitimacy of Assad regime but you see that the Assad regime is been rehabilitated by the Arab world and uh now they are conducting almost business as usual for us no it's a principled position he has not legitimacy there needs to be accountability for all the crimes committed against the Syrian people but again this does not prevent us from interactions with the regime at the lower level so there are lower level contacts in order to deliver our messages to try to engage them to make sure that they deliver on their commitments in the UN L process uh to solve the Syrian crisis or to deliver assistance to people because un agencies are on the ground they are helping the displaced people internally displaced people uh poor people etc etc so so in order to be able also to work with the UN we need to have access we need to have contacts and again the EU delegation is one of the few embassies of the EU member states who are still present on the ground so and through these we are able to achieve things small things of course we will not change the overall situation but again we are not interventionists the change of the situation has to come from within and the migration yeah I mean uh you refer probably to the recent decision in Germany to uh send back certain unsuccessful Asylum Seekers back to countries like Syria or Afghanistan again each case is different so these cases need to be handled and R evaluate it individually and of course we don't want to have people who commit crimes in the EU we should be able to decide who do we allow to our territory and this is the competence of Our member states so the member states need to make this choice this assessment individually they cannot expose vulnerable people to possible risks in these regime so if you send an opposition activist from from Europe to Syria you can be sure that they will be killed or tortured so you you don't do it but uh after individually evaluating uh each case the countries have the right and competence to decide whether whether they will um repatriate someone or not all right and it doesn't have to be to that country it can be in the direction of that country yes so yeah let us let us move on there is of there's infinitely more topics to cover so we can't do that and I I I try to be conservative with our time um so let us move on to the of course the next big thing is I believe many people are looking towards November to the to the United States the elections that are going to be happening there soon um of course kamla Harris versus Donald Trump um I was really wondering has the um as a foreign foreign policy is there any has there any scenarios been made has there any discussions been had on um what kind of impact both presidents could have on the European Union um will how will one uh candidate affect the European Union over the other can you say a little bit about that yes of course our approach by default is we seek engagement I mentioned that before this is like we always and especially in case of countries that are probably our closest Ally the United States are the most like-minded partner we have around the world because of the Short History the language the principles the we are all based on Democratic principles and and traditionally the transatlantic link so this is the this is how we call the relations between EU and and the US like this transatlantic partnership was always the Cornerstone of our security and stability I would dare to say that it's also a Cornerstone of the global stability and security because together with the United States we are the the most powerful we have the most powerful militaries because we are bound also in the NATO it's nothing related to the EU but like two-thirds of our members are also members of the NATO so militarily we are the biggest biggest uh entity and biggest force in the world economically in terms of Market investment and money we are the biggest in the world so we have enormous leverage over the world in order to protect the principles and values we believe in so I think it's in the interest of the Americans and us to continue working together but of course during the first Trump first Trump Administration we made specific experience about how unilateral he can be how ignorant he can be and of course we are prepared for any scenario that might come after the elections but of course we are not interfering it's the elections it's the it's the choice of American people and we will adjust ourselves whatever result there will be you yeah there there will probably be needing some adjustments um but maybe a bit deeper on that um user hello High asks the following um why should the USA help Europe with Russia in an event that with further escalation I imagine that they're referring to um when Europe refuses to help the USA with China um take that as you will but can you say a little bit about that don't know I accept that there might be such um perceptions but we have very uh intense dialogue intensive dialogue with the US on China we have exchanges in many things we agree we don't agree on certain things because um it seems that the US Administration chose for some kind of seeing China as a threat as a challenge as a threat we in the EU see China a little bit in a more differentiated way we see China first as a strategic partner because without China we will not solve Global problems such as global warming Iranian nuclear program China sits in the in the UN Security Council as a permanent member so they can block any International Global activity so we need to work with them on the issues of global interest but then we are also economic competitors we are competing for the same markets we are competing for investment they are you know copying our Technologies and try to compete with us in terms of uh economy copying like near near stealing sometimes you could you could almost say I'm official I have to be diplomatic in my remark we know what we are talking about but again it's it's mutually beneficial that we have uh we have this economic relationship because our investments are helping create China jobs and feed their people and on the other hand just look around yourself everything you find is made in China almost everything so without China you know they are producing everything for us so it's a mutual dependency we want to the risk so we want to create dangerous depend like we did with Russia and fossil fuel so we took the lesson we learned the lesson and and we are trying to adjust our relationship in this sense but we are still working together economically although we are also competing and then we are strategic rivals or systemic Rivals sorry systemic Rivals because our systems are rival link itself we are democracy based on human rights and respect for Citizens they are autocracy or dictatorship based on one party rule but again United States is it differently but we work together on many issues with the Americans and why America should help should help us with Russia it's not America is helping us America would be helping Ukraine and America is helping the global World Order because Russia is a threat for the global system of rules they are violating International La Big scale they brought War back on the European continent after 70 or 80 years after the traumatic experience of the second world war and they do it in a most brutal fashion targeting civilians and targeting you know civilian infrastructure disregarding their own commitments legal commitments agreement they signed they are just simply ignoring so this is this is not the way to go and it's in the interest of America not to leave this unanswered because if Russia gets away if Putin gets away with this Behavior then there is plenty of other actors around this world who have territorial aspirations at their neighbors who want to create buffer zones or extend their zones of influence and are Reckless enough to use the force and all of them are watching how the International Community understand EU and us because we are the Democratic forces in this world how we will react to this because if we don't then the others will be encouraged in Middle East in Africa in Asia and then we have Mayhem in the world yeah I well personally I agree um I'm not sure what the what the current stands of Eid simples but I I personally I I I I totally agree with that um I know we have a few more minutes left we we're nearing the end if you if you don't mind to stay like two or three more more minutes um because there's a very this kind of seg is very nicely into another question for everyone that's watching thank you but um if you really want your question answered uh please make sure to use super chat uh and then I will ask the question um before we go uh anyways that really is a nice Segway towards the I'm sure you've heard of it the the the druggy report that came out a few days ago and the I think spec specifically for your uh field of expertise the mentions of the risking and cutting depend dependencies uh lifting strategic autonomy all of those um all of those topics sound um very important and Could you um maybe go a little bit more into these and what your uh what you and your office takes away from that report or like what your um how you are connected to this report if if at all well the report is is a set of very good recommendations that might be taken up and implemented uh in the new Mandate of the new commission so in this sense there's not really much for me to comment I can only say that this a because the European Union is constantly evolving organism we are a project I mean we all are EU Elliot you are the EU your users your your viewers are the EU we all are shaping the EU the EU is not a construct that is imposed on the people the the the construct the Brussels whatever we do as institutions needs to reflect the wishes of people or to work for the benefit of the people so these reports this let's say this feedback this mirror on how the EU Works where the EU FS are very important and it's part of our Evolution because this help us helps us to adjust where we have shortcomings where we are maybe just going you know out of the routine and we stopped being Innovative and the report from this perspective is very important because it pinpoints areas which are very important the structure of our industry how do we invest how do we do research and Innovation so this is very important and I think this will fit into the policym in the next few months and years because if we want to if you want to maintain the standing of the EU as a world class economic power the biggest single Market in the world the highest performing economy in the world then we of course we need to go uh uh hand inand with the developments in in the world nowadays so this will be for our successors so that's why for me it's great to see that there are people who care and I only hope that this will be really taken uh very seriously and implemented and the the the political guidelines of the new commission uh are already Focus on the areas which are identified in this druggy report so I think this is very good it can it can only contribute to EU becoming even better for its citizens because in the end this is what the EU is all about to deliver for the citizens so that we really can um make sure that this project stays what it was about when it was founded it was about peace stability and prosperity for the people not for the elite but for the people okay um Peter I want to thank you very very much about talking uh with us basically about about all of these very interesting topics I believe you could sit here for another two hours and go through every single continent country position um but of course we don't have the time unfortunately uh so everyone I want to thank you for watching Peter do you have anything La Last Words anything you would maybe plug or or or something you want to share with the crowd before we before we sign off please do so thank you very much just very big thanks for your time and uh the questions you you made made and all the comments you made also in the chat this is very important for us for the EU to have the feedback because I keep repeating this is a project for the citizens and it's up to each of us to contribute to shaping this uh this project this might sound KY but actually if you think about it you can coshape it by your public engagement by talking to people but trying to find more about what the EU does how the EU does it and interact with your elected representatives who are there then participating in the decision- making in Brussels so this is this is my plea for everyone just take Keen interest in the EU don't perceive and don't allow the EU to be portrayed as something remote because EU is US EU is what we live every day in our countries uh this is the about member states about people in the member states and it's good that you cared because you joined this debate and for this I I thank you really very much absolutely uh so that's that's right dear viewers a big shout out to you guys as well uh so if that's if that's all uh once again thank you for watching and I I would love to see you you guys on the next live stream have a good afternoon evening morning depending on where you are and goodbye bye-bye"
