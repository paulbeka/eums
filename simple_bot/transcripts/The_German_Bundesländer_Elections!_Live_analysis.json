    "transcription": "e e hello hello first of all can people hear me because I think we are live um so please let me know in the comments if you if you can hear me we had a bit of technical issues before so hopefully they have been resolved so there we go awesome well great to see you all here thank you for joining this uh this live stream and um we have a packed agenda tonight because as you've probably seen already there were there were elections in Germany and right on your screen now I am sharing a map of Germany to make it very clear what these elections were about so for anyone confused these were not federal elections not or whatever like national elections they were not national elections these were state elections so right on the screen you can see thuringia or turingan in German and sax Zakon in in in Germany and both these states had their local Regional elections and that is what we are talking about today and I'm not doing this alone we have two awesome guests to join us so first um from now soon onwards we will have Simone from the EU andu and later also and this is a big moment for the EU Made Simple too we have a the well the chief political editor for do chll who will join us at quarter to 8 today to talk about everything so two awesome guests and are really excited to talk about about them about everything that happened happened uh this evening or actually today during the voting anyway anyway um but without further Ado let's get the first guest on here like get started straight away this is Simone skelli I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly he is from the EU andu follow them in Instagram if you if you like him or if you if you want to see more about them and he has done his thesis all about populism in German in Germany so populism populist parties in Germany which are very excited to get into today so without further Ado Simone I think you are now here Hi how are you thank you for joining the live stream uh hi lberto thanks a lot for uh for having me today so I'm really pleased to to be here and also to actually talk about this amazing topic list for me awesome awesome well let's jump straight into it Simon um so we do have a little bit of delay for everyone here so bear with us but I think it should work fine during during this uh during this live stream Simone how do these elections work so there are two provinces in Germany and they voted is that correct or could you explain the pro so uh the sorry gone gone sorry I think there might be a a bit of delay go on explain explain ahead what happened today okay okay so so basically today there will be two bundas ler so two states uh in Germany that will decide uh about the composition of their state Parliament and also of the Minister President so they actually first Minister uh of the of the of the State uh these elections are usually usually take place every five years uh for uh for States uh but there is only one state that is actually takes uh every four year is old every four years and uh voters have when they reach The Ballot Box they have two uh pieces of paper so they cast a first vote that uh is actually for a a candidate so a personalized candidate of the 88 um single member constituencies that actually um make up the the turingan and the 12 then make Saxony and uh then uh they actually uh the ones who wins who gets elected is the one that receives the most of these votes and gets elected and uh this is actually called the direct seat then there is an second vote for the state party list so the seats are allocated according to a proportion of the second votes and it's called least seats so uh the direct seats actually are subtracted from the parties leas seats so that all the parties receive seats in compensation if there is um let's say uh if there is a party that obtains more direct seats than leas seats I know it's quite complicated but as as many of of the Electoral of the Electoral systems in in Europe and in general I think in the world I think so too simoney because what I think is very interesting in Germany and for everyone here watching us they're really trying to mix two concepts in democracies right because you have the direct representation which is the first past the post also in England that they have because the winner of all the little Pro I mean what do you call them constituencies within turingia would have one person that directly makes into the Parliament and then they have proportional representation too which is the second vote correct where then there's list yes exactly yeah yeah yeah so I think exactly we call that the German system is actually called personalized proportional representation because there is the first clor post as a personal so he has a actually votes for a person that is actually directly chosen as you correctly mentioned and this should in principle should actually ensure a closer relationship between the voters and the representatives but actually it's uh not in reality it's not like this because uh people tend to choose their their uh their representatives because they actually are from that party of that other party so there is a sort of op laang of the two of the two votes in general right so so I think for the audience the key thing to realize here and it's really interesting definitely look into it and I'm releasing a video tomorrow morning to show explain exactly this people in Germany always get two votes right and um those two votes then there's a big calculation that happens and this then determines the the Parliament and let's you know Simon let's start straight with Zakon so Zakon is a province at the very Eastern Germany um and um they voted today and this is a hogn no in Germany which means a oh God what's the English word a a um not it's not final projection projection thank yeah projection yes yeah exactly a projection and um as you can see here I mean Simone I mean again some people might have been living under a rock so at the moment here the first place is CDU who who is CDU maybe quickly yes quickly explaining it's the Sid is the Christian democrats uh it's the party from Angela Merkel basically and it's been the longlasting governing uh party for the past 20 years in Germany at least federally speaking now after Angela Merkel uh she left the place to coalition government at least federally uh from SPD uh deuna so the Socialists the greens and the and liberals right but um it's it's been a very much of um of a dominant political force also in I mean in the past years after the unification in uh in uh East Germany because it was advocating for the stabilization of the economy that was actually uh coming out from a social uh um let's say system and was diving into the capitalist democracy that uh actually Germany lives in now interesting and and it was also um advocating for economic recovery so Market reforms the integration of East Germany into the whole European union and so sedu gained a lot of uh of consensus at least uh in the '90s but then it was soon very soon challenged by the Linka that was the natural hair of the of the Socialist Unity party that was the former uh ruling party in the DDF and then because and then the link was very easy challenging the the to do because capitalizing that Nostalgia of the Dead air time where everything was under control and there was no dissatisfaction with economics and stuff but very interestingly we have that in the past two decades and especially since the uh the the European Sovereign Deb crisis in 2013 14 that kind of period you have a new new challenging parties like afda alternative for Dutchland alternative for Germany and uh currently now very recently in the past eight months there was a spin-off from D Linka and there is buar vages so Alliance from Z zarag yeah she's actually um a daughter of the East German because uh basically she was a militant of the Socialist Unity party and then the Linka after a few years she tried to fill a gap in the German political Arena that was why not merging uh left leaning stances in economics and right-wing stances I know it's insane but Simone I wanna I want to stop you for a minute because we're we're going all over so we have the CDU so merkel's party you know the center right in Germany the ones that are also leading in the National polls by the way so that's the that's the left black one and they're just ahead of the IFD and again for those been living under Rock um and maybe Simon maybe explain a little bit about who are the afd and especially who's who's um I mean do you know who who's who's leading them there maybe a little bit about their leadership yeah so so basically in uh in um I is is a party it's been um it's a recent party it is only 10 years old actually this year or last year in 2013 was actually established and um it has gone through a radical change because it was born as um a party that was liberal in terms of economic stances and was euroskeptic it was just uh established by Ben Lua he's um a former professor of Economics at University okay in Germany and uh he he's been quite uh quite of a of a character in Germany because established in Eastern Germany Simone was it established in Eastern Germany or yeah yeah basically yes yes it's a son of of East Germany as well okay but uh it's been it's been quite of a of an interesting uh metamorphosis the one of AF because since 2015 so after the the Angela merel policy of welcoming migrants in Germany there has been a rise into the um let's say islamophobia and uh also let's say intolerance towards the the diversity in general in Germany and they uh and they had this kind of um of metamorphosis because starting from the uh from let's say a protest against the the economic stances of Germany towards the the the resolution of the Sovereign Deb crisis it went towards more of a cultural uh right-wing party so uh establish triggering those kind of mechanisms that actually make a populist party uh basically so it's been uh it's been a very strong metamorphosis and especially in turingan for example it's uh it's been the it's the first part in turingan basically uh hold on Simone we're we're we're in Zakon right now but now we are in zon yes yes now we are in zon so just for just for our viewers very quickly because some new ones might have joined oh oh wait I'm looking the one on here so just so that we know what we're talking about we are talking about is this working this doesn't seem to be working uh here we go let me do this again bear with us everyone here we go so we are talking about Saxony here so this very Eastern Province right there and turingia is where the other election took place um so let's let's let's maybe before we go there finish off Saxony yeah yeah yeah let's finish Saxony so basically Saxony it's a it's a it's a a state in which um we have uh we have that basically after it's the one it's the second power but um it's actually um performing well because uh you have that East Germany in general is actually neglected is perceived as neglected uh from the federal government and so they they want a change Sim are they maybe let me let me challenge do you think they are to be honest uh the there there are plenty of people Germans in particular German uh political scientists that deem that the integration and unification of Germany is not concluded at all and it actually it's uh it's a bit like plenty of the countries in Europe I'm From Italy so you have that there is this divide between the North and the South or uh the United Kingdom is bit like the same North and the South so uh it's normal that there are with countries that are very that have this uh particularly difficult history in terms of unification you have this kind of of divides that continue to persist especially economically and socially and it must be said that uh once uh East Germany was industrialized but when it was reunification with West Germany it was de-industrialized now we can the employ unemployment starting to rise now issues are are much better but still uh there is uh there is still a lot of diversity between West Germany and East Germany yeah I mean and this is also and this is maybe the segue so we talked about number one in Sak CDU at the moment things might change we have IFD number two so both of these are I mean the CDU center right IFD is far right but then we have an interesting case which is the third party here and I know you already started talking about it but maybe I thought it was really interesting you said BV is leftwing with conservative policies too so so how does that work maybe explain a little bit what they are yeah I mean it's a strange animal for any political scientist that uh tends to to classify parties from a left right uh segment so it's quite complicated to to position it a bit better but basically what Sarah vnes does and has done is to be uh very left leaning in in terms of economic policies so for example uh especially at the federal level she promised to increase the the salaries she promised to actually bring down unemployment so it's actually any normal Socialist Party would would have done the same right well actually it's very interesting it's uh it stuns in terms of uh social and cultural and also foreign policy for example you have that uh uh she's very Pro Russia in the sense so she's I mean she's she has some sympathies for Russia a bit like the colleagues of ifda so that's why here you can tell that there is a connection between the left and right like a circle that at the end they touch the poles uh when you reach the extremes then you have uh that uh they want to stop giving support to Ukraine especially in terms of military um equipment and also financially speaking because there are priorities that is German Germany and we also have recently we had uh this uh statement by uh Christian Linda that is the current Finance Minister in Germany and is from fdp that actually not even on the list why because it's uh pretty actually probable that they won't make to actually go over the 5% hardle that there is to access the the parliament the state Parliament and it's not it's not the first time and it was actually the on the moment which it happened it was the moment in which Christian ler the current Secretary of the FTP uh came to the came to the stage let's put like this and he was I was just mentioning that uh he was still a bit uh declared that um it's uh it's controversial also in Germany to continue to support uh Ukraine financially because they didn't have the money to do that yeah also because of for uh constitutional constraints but uh that's another story um simoney we have we have questions in the chat by the way and i' would love to get people in a a chance to ask you questions while you are here and everyone in the chat just quickly if you do want your questions answered please tag me so I know that there's a question and if you want to be 100% sure that your question gets answered then a Super Chat would would be needed but please always tag me so I can quickly see the questions tag e made simple of course so uh first question here from double yikes and um let me read it out to you how many positions in local or Regional elections would IFD need to hold to be able to force or persuade a deal with the CDU on governance so we're getting into coalitions the I yes yes okay okay so coalitions are quite uh problematic in general uh especially in Germany because uh basically AF has three powers in his hand it's three uh yeah three three powers that could actually leverage so the first one is that if it's able to gather onethird of the seats I actually possible apparently yeah uh it could have a a minority opposition so for example that there is there is the need of a qualified majority in state parliaments and also in federal parliament in the fact in the buen stock to actually change the state constitution also or or to re to name judges uh for the for the state court so basically it has a big Power in his hands the second one is that uh usually uh if uh it's able to gather the first place so to be the first Power in in the state um he can actually name the president of the state parliament of course it has to be approved by vote uh from the whole Parliament but still he can actually name it and we have to say the last thing is that uh uh usually mainstream parties in Germany are working on on a so-call brand M that it's in the translation is the firewall the firewall against ifda so they will actually try to pursue any kind of Coalition uh negotiation with any party but I and this is is going to be the case for example in Zakon where Ted already I was reading in DPI in the Deutch press agent um that Ted is actually willing to start a coalition with SP and eona so with the greens and the Socialists which is a possibility here right it shows it already this is a possibility yeah it's a possibility it's a possibility and also I have to say it would be quite uh problematic to explain to voters of s because currently SP and Duna are actually the parties of the coalition government or the federal coalition government and so uh you have that this is a a big deal for SED in terms of credibility because they have uh position themselves as one of the credible the only credible uh let's say opposition to the to the ample Coalition so the traffic light Coalition it will be quite problematic yeah you know because it's funny I live in Germany right so I see interviews of big politicians so the the boss the CDU head of the CDU is Fred matz and he also said he made it very clear he does he' rather not deal with the greens and Maka he's from the CSU who works with the CDU he also said he doesn't really want to work with the greens so it would be yeah yeah it will be problematic also because Zar vagan as well said that the most dangerous political force in the bundestag in the German Parliament is the greens right yeah and we have to mention that AF it's in the parliament it's the bu so telling that the gruna are actually uh much more dangerous than than afda tells a big story I have to say yeah yeah simoney I want I want to get to another question from the chat this is from a person called hgvd thank you very much for being a patreon hbd and he's asking is it known how other parties are doing and are there some interesting smaller parties coming up is there anything you'd like to mention on that I mean the BSW is a big one of course but yeah yeah now it's a big one but actually it's a eight months uh old so it's not a very Consolidated party then if we talk if we look at the old little little parties that are actually named in orders usually uh in uh in the in the HS they are actually in the last row in Gray and they're called olders yeah and they are the old ones that uh uh adding up to anyone if you actually add up every everything every of them you don't reach the 5% so they are not very very uh relevant because you have to actually uh we have to admit the Germans in general are quite conservative in their uh positions apart from the fact that in state parli in state elections state level elections the turnout uh is of course lower respect to the to the to the federal elections but you have that non-established parties have better chances of gathering more votes because there is this willingness to experiment because there is much less at stake in the state Parliament because if you look at the if you consider the the competences of federal parliaments you have that they work on police on culture and education so they're actually much less at stake for example they have no power in in actually taking the um taking over the the competence on migration for example even though they are like border border states they still don't have any power on that yeah but uh probably one of the most relevant things in the in state elections is that the state elections influence uh the bundas rat the bundas rat it's actually the hoer Chamber of the of the German Parliament yeah where where actually uh let's say state representatives are actually there and take the stances of the of the state they represent so Simone let me let me hold you because I I love this and it's really cool for the audience to understand this so um let let me first explain the basics so for example I think you have 14 bundas lenda in Germany right yes so that means there's 14 State parliaments so Germany split up in 14 pieces and each piece has a state Parliament that's what happened today here in Zakon on the screen so one of these states Zakon these are the results and then Simone if I'm correct the next level would be the bundist so this is the federal the federal Parliament for all of Germany and then you're mentioning that above that if I'm correct there's the bundesrat as a second chamber is that correct or yes is a second chamber exactly actually we cannot say that it's above the Bund but probably they are actually in uh let's say have the same power even though even though actually they can it's not very correct from a constitutional point to say that they have the same power but still uh it's a second chamber that's and the second chamber who is that how is that one put together the bundas the bundus the bundes it's uh it's very much complicated to do this but basically basically the way in which it's uh it's uh it takes place the the choice of the representatives are or usually that they get elected as in the in the or they're actually the expression of the state parliaments right so it depends it depends but basically uh basically the bundus right is very is a very complicated part of the of the German of the German system and it's actually the one that uh could uh together with the bundestag could actually file uh towards the Constitutional Court a demand of uh of for example uh dissolution of a party right because because okay Germany is it's uh is is very delicate in and it's also quite cautious in maintaining its uh its democracy because it was challenged democratically uh once already so they needed to put in place some safeguards in order to to to keep it together and it's quite interesting because uh uh because it's called in German it's called democracy or um the after democracy so militant democracy right right that is able to self to self uh self- protect itself right and so sorry sbody I I hate interrupting I'm just I'm just very conscious of time and I really would love to ask there's so many cool questions in the chat um and firstly politics for fun thank you for your Super Chat really appreciate it and his question is is there a comeback chance for Olaf Schultz because the SBD um just very quickly as info for everyone here the ruling government in Germany on a national federal level is the SPD the red ones on the screen the greens the green ones on the screen and the fdp who not even in this screen because they did so badly so the SP SPD here's the big one because that's where the bundes celor or the the boss of Germany I'm just going to put it very informally is from is there a is there a comeback chance for him because he's losing everywhere yeah uh the problem is that uh it will be uh pretty difficult to hold together Germany now especially in one year time to the bundas uh the bundes so the the actually the the federal elections uh it remains to be seen because um you have to say that plenty of the of party leaders uh usually come back but let's say timidly very shyly because um let's say there are some there are some part some parties for example FTP in which the past leader disappeared from the scenes because he actually was very very sad not entering the the federal Parliament so that one was a very serious ground for not coming back here it's actually just a shift a shift of preferences so maybe there will be a chance for Olaf Schultz to come back I don't I don't feel uh enough confident to exclude the possibility of a comeback he's not well he's not it's not going well for him though is it let's be honest no it's not it's not that's for sure but actually because it's not bold enough in my opinion in the sense that's uh is it tends to let's say be guided by the wind so if the if Paul say that please you have to be kinder to Ukraine he he becomes kinder to Ukraine if he has to be more conservative it becomes more conservative so it's it's quite in in the in the when he tries to balance the different pressure from from the different interest groups it does is not very able to uh actually uh lead to coherence in his positions so probably that's the big problem of the left in general in the European Union but also in in Germany so also we have to admit that as for day uh as a governing party it's it's fine if he performs bad because when you are in the government and you have ends on the problems you cannot solve them all and that's for sure so it's pretty normal and also because and the state elections could also be regarded as Shadow Federal elections in the sense that the parties that are represented in boom stock and usually uh tend to be in the coalition government have to pass a review so if it's uh if the if the test is not met or the for example the the preferences are not met you have an issue and you perform poly I mean Simone let's uh let's break through the ice right I mean together SPD gruna and the fdp who you can't see have won less than 15% I mean that's that's insane I mean and when we look at touring we still haven't looked at touring in but it doesn't matter we'll do that soon um it's a similar story um you know that I I think let's very no let's park that first want to ask all of these questions um so they've not doing well next question though uh we have another patreon question Villa thank you being for being a a patron and he's asking what are the current relations between BV and IFD have any of them expressed a willingness to work together and if not has bsv um expressed another interest uh so basically that's a a pretty a pretty difficult question because yeah he's a he's known for that he's known for that yeah it's it's quite difficult for for two reasons basically both are populist parties okay and I would like to open a little parenthesis on populism populist parties in general uh have this ten to to portrit themselves as the only and only one party that holds the truth and holds the the the representation the total representation of the masses of the people so all the preferences and the will of the people are actually enshrined in their in their uh in their policy so no populist party will tell you oh yes I'm I'm I I like half day they hate pluralism they don't want to be merged with somebody else because they hold the truth and this truth is actually the will of the people that they think they deem and there are plenty of people who think that uh that oh yes populism it's actually the The Cure of representative democracy because it's in crisis and it's actually embodying the direct representation of people actually it's not true because uh for the sake of being responsive to to to the preferences of of Voters you neglect was the greater good of the country for example or just to to to be to be concrete uh no no migration amazing then you have a big problem in demographics in in Germany or you end up like the United Kingdom that for a long period after brexit they had no uh no people working doing let's say less Noble jobs let's put like this yeah so or for example you have a a decreasing decreasing uh population and you don't have no German no pure blood German as they call to actually replace them so Simone I'm gonna stop you there again before we go to turingan um yeah I'd love to have your statement just quick answer who do you think will form the government in Zakon while looking at this do you think it will be CDD greens or something else okay I have to say that if we look at the at the credibility I just take the shoes of a leader okay the leader would be quite ashamed to co to coales both with zarag and dun so actually I would choose the word the actually the less worse that is actually the the usuna because being with zarag I don't know you don't know okay okay you know what we're going to do um we're going to ask the chat also so I'm creating a poll right now um about who you think will be the government in Zakon before we move over to turingan so let me just type this out one second add one last option CDU bsv so please be rational actors as the leaders and vote for yeah that actually is the most likely I have to say yeah anyway while people are answering that poll let's uh let's to Turing my God one second let me open turingan here we go this is crazy by the way look at that this is insane anyway what are your what are your first thoughts seeing this my first thoughts are have to say trivial trivial we expected that because turingan it's the party the the the state in which I it's most powerful also thanks to his leader the local leader B Oka please let me spend few words on B Oka so BJ Oka very quickly he's the afd leader right I leader yes I State leader okay so it is really well known to local authorities especially the courts the state courts because uh he has been uh fined by the state uh Court to pay I don't know few thousand few thousand Euros uh to because he actually used Nazi wording uh Nazi motos in a in a in a public uh appearance and actually um he said I was not aware of that and then the judge replied I I I I I knew that you were a history teacher how how couldn't you know that so basically we we have also to be clear for non German speakers and I'm one of them but still I am trying to learn um German is a very precise language so has a lot a lot of words and if you don't use the peculiar one you get out of the context there are some particular wording that is actually confined to the Nazi Heritage people don't use it in public right so so just to summarize so B hooker the leader of the IFD so everyone you can see here IFD won in turingan right they biggest the biggest party in Turing State elections and their leader is someone called B hooker like Simone just explained and he's probably correct me if I'm wrong the most extreme member of the IFD that is in a leadership position yes yes yes and I mean this is quite fascinating he he won the pro he won the state um so people must yeah yeah and just to mention as I said before just to remind that he could actually name president of the state Parliament could choose at least if everything comes like this and remains like this he could choose at least try to propose to the parliament the leader of the state Parliament right moreover another thing that is quite interesting is that Bon Oka uh is the leader also of a let's say of um of a current in the in the if that is called the flugal the flugal in in English it's the wing yeah and it's the most uh right-wing wing of the party very rad of IFD yeah exactly of IFD and every leader that tried to suck it and actually to to set him aside and from from the party so exclude him from the party was the one leaving the party just to mention and he's also the one that is actually responsible from this metamorphosis of this metamorphosis from a Euros skeptical economically liberal movement into a nativist until is Islamic and climate denialist party right this is actually what we are witnessing at the moment and he the one that actually has created this set of enemies of villains of the German people that are actually immigrants islamists and European bureaucrats right Sim very it's super interesting I could talk with you all day Simone the only issue is we only have a couple more minutes of your time so before we have the next guest so um let me let me let me ask you a big thing that like really shoots off the page here the left boom and BSW up is BSW simply taking votes from the left or is that a wrong interpretation no actually it's not a wrong interpretation because um Zar vagan did a very A very wise choice because we have to say that uh in turingan in the past elections and I'll tell you this that it's actually from a paper the in the past elections you have that populist stances are basically the causes of populism are basically two so economic distress so discontent and cultural backlash cultural change and there is this uh these three political scientists that assessed that in during in particular the biggest driver of the vote that actually gained AF was because of the cultural backlash of preventing the cultural backlash actually protecting the cultural heritage of traditional Germany of the traditional a rural and theu East Germany and this is what actually Zarah vages understood as well in jingan that's why she performed so well so probably even though it's not uh it's not evident she took also some of the votes of the of those dis of that discontent from the left especially from SPD of that that liberal stance and probably also from sadu right okay I mean it's it's remarkable because she went from zero% I mean she didn't even exist like what nine months ago and now eight months ago yeah eight months ago sorry and she went from zero to 15.6% it's insane yes insane insane yeah yeah Simone any um maybe maybe tell the audience before you leave us where they can find you I mean you're from the EU andu maybe you want to say some last words about that before I let you go and thank you for your yeah so so uh just uh just few words about in andu it's a it's um an association of students basically and also uh recent graduates it's uh it's we we work we especially work on raising awareness about European union and a bit like bit like you made simple probably in this in this sense we are actually concurrent but uh but still uh we work especially on the on let's say on bringing on bringing European Union nearer to voters especially to young voters uh about me you can find me on Instagram my name is pretty complicated because it's in German it's called troyal maybe maybe you can find me in the in the description of the of the post haven't if you haven't put it in yet put put in the chat later when you're watching that' be yes yes I will I will I will for sure I will for sure so thank you very much for having me uh if you have any more questions you can send me um um DM on Instagram awesome Simone great having you on have a have a great evening and thank you like I said thank you for coming on it's it's been a pleasure thanks a lot a pleasure for me too right goodbye goodbye so uh we have our next guest coming in five minutes so it's very exciting because we're going to have melna on and she's the chief political editor for do CH I I actually think she's already on so um without further Ado I think um I can yeah yeah Mel I think you're here right can you hear me yes hi I was actually just trying to fix the technology to talk to you ah really hi hi hi you're a bit early but we would love to love to talk to you earlier so um um thank you for making to the eom simple live stream really appreciate it it's a big honor for us at eom simple to have someone like you on the on the on the on the stream and I'm not sure if you can see the live stream but I'm basically sharing um the results in turingan and we'd love to like ask you uh what you think of of of the results and maybe explain what happened in touring and if that's if that's all right for you well in in the ringia we saw an outright victory for the far right afd party this is not that terribly surprising because the polls had been pointing in that direction for quite some time and um this really is a historic first for the far right afd party here in Germany this will send a shock through the nation at the same time I want to stress Nationwide the farad afds at about 16% here it's about 30 we'll see what the night will bring so in terms of trying to project this onto Germany as a whole it would be the tail wagging the dog rather right right but I mean they won massively um and the big question I'm getting from the audience that's watching at the moment is um is all about can they form a Coalition in Turing and they're the winner but no one wants to work with them or is that wrong interpretation yeah nobody will work with them that's for sure um you have all the parties um the other parties vowing they would not enter a coalition I'm here in at the actual the regional parliament of neighboring Saxy which also went to the polls today but we'll get to that um but clearly they have no chance of actually being in government but coming first in election for a party which is led by B hucker their Regional he regionally he can legally be called a fascist um this is a a part of the party that is being um looked into by German domestic security because they are seen as extreme right not just far right and the same is for neighboring Saxy where I am right now so there's no chance there will be in government at the same time you can't ignore almost a third of Voters who went to the polls and we've seen a very large turnout it really has risen his upward of 74% uh so that was a pretty big show uh of Voters really voicing their concerns and also their unhappiness with the central government because two out of three parties Who currently run Germany didn't even make it into the parliament of heringa yeah yeah it's crazy I mean I I think it's very interesting what you just said right because a third of the people in turingia they voted for the afd and there's this red wall against the afd that no one will work with them but maybe a very open question is is that correct is that even Democratic to so to speak or or that's the argument that the FD keeps playing is that is that a right argument or not well let's put it this way Germany has a proportional system so you see proportional um backing of parties everybody has the right to vote for whichever party they want to as long as they are part of the political Spectrum which the far right afd is but at the same time there's a debate whether uh there should be a process to try and get them banned because um that's why ger domestic intelligence is looking into them they might be violating the Constitution they um are accused of undermining democracy itself so there's a right to vote for whoever you want but there's no Duty by other parties who have a mandate from their own voters to go into a coalition with others I mean let's just remind ourselves that going into coalitions can cost you very dearly in terms of political support as well right I mean but the difficulty will be for the other parties I assume is finding a coalition without the afd right because where will the majorities come from I mean if I look at this page CDU SPD BSW seems like the only possibility or what what do you what do you think yeah yes that will be a very tricky one um particularly when they start talking about content the far right afd isn't just anti migration there we've seen uh and and but they are also um anti- supporting Ukraine and some of those policies are echoed um within the buness it's a party that basically splintered off from the left party and uh a leading figure there left the left and has now basically crushingly uh taken voters from the left uh in in seringa but also here in Saxony but it's also taking voters from the far right afd party so Zar it's only a couple of months old it's a very small party around about 100 real members and they are really um proving to be uh in line with or representing the sentiment of a lot of people which is a lot of frustration in particularly those two eastern states yeah yeah yeah definitely I mean maybe maybe just I'm looking at we have an audience watching so if I keep watching away it's basically because I'm scanning questions M I'm not ignoring you I'm gonna put some light on for you as well so do keep talking to me but I've set up this up the wrong way so I'm going to try and set this up properly ah okay okay great but I can talk and talk and Fiddle at the same time no worries sending the questions um we have a couple we got a couple hundred viewers watching now and hopefully we'll have more later and one of them is asking from Sebastian grunfeld why does the CDO not ask its voters whether or not they should work with the afd that's a bit of an interesting one not sure if that would work but um what do you think about that that that approach well the CDU the conservative party stands for Christian Democratic Union and um the CDU itself tried to create a difference between well this new laun newly launched postm CDU is led by someone called Fred who the former adversary of um Angela Markel the former Chancellor and he tried to shift it further um to the right in the sense of further into conservatism again it was felt that it was too far on Social Democrat more kind of Center left territory and now the conservative CDU party wants to maintain what is called a firewall against the extreme right they do not want to be seen cooperating with fascists and I'll just remind everyone that the leader of the farad afd party in the state of seringa can legally be called a fascist and he basically he's also anti-business actually he um just told a bunch of mediumsized company leaders who published a letter and basically called on um people to vote for diversity reminding people that the wealth created in Germany is uh also thanks to uh skilled workers coming from abroad he basically told them where to go and said I hope that you run out of business so I think that is a distinct difference also between the kind of trumpist populist right-wing agenda anti- migration and what you're seeing here with the the farri right afd party that it's you know it's a very different political culture and seeing business as a as an enemy uh seem is almost it's kind of a left position as well that he's taking there that big business is to blame for social inequality let's move the conversation a little bit to the SBD grun and fdp because they are for people watching and if you've been living on her Rock they are ruling Germany at the moment that's the ruling um uh AA Coalition they've done badly here I mean the SPD dropped the greens dropped out of the entire parliament in turingan and the fdp is on 1.2% what in your eyes is the future of this of this Coalition this Coalition will stay together because they have nowhere to go and um these figures are not representative I do have to I have to stress that this fall is not representative of what we're seeing in the general polling in Germany so it's it's it's the exception from the law having said that uh for a party that has the Finance Minister the pro business free Democrats uh their leader Christian lner for the fdp not even to show up on the political radar anymore here in Saxony they are amongst the bracket of others and for two out of three uh parties to be thrown out of the ringan parliament together Who currently sit in Berlin and make a policy for Europe's largest economy um that is quite addressing down at The Ballot Box but these are rather small states a couple of million people true Germany has 83 million inhabitants it is not representative for Germany but it will continue the criticism of the so-called traffic light Coalition because they're red yellow green um which already are seeing particularly Olaf Schultz is seeing an all-time low in approval ratings for his daughter's German Chancellor yeah yeah I mean we have a we have a question here from uh thank you for your question and he's asking you is why is it that the far ends of the political Spectrum do so well in East Germany the short answer is because there's a deep distrust of parties at the center they are seen as the establishment that's also how the far right afd um continue to try and frame them so um what is a big tent party or former Big 10 parties in terms of the conservatives the social Democrats um and also to a certain degree the greens um ahead of the last elections um to the far right they are seen as establishment and and kind of a political adversary also in the sense of how the political system works and here particularly in the East um there is a resentment there is a huge level of frustration interestingly unemployment rates in east and west are about the same like between five and 6% so there's no huge difference um the um pensions are now the same wages aren't quite the same but cost of living is cheaper in the East so it kind of EES out to a certain degree but this this more than 30 years after ger reunification there still is a sense and we've seen this in the polling very much that East Germans feel like second class citizens so this is very emotional and it's very much about where people who live in the East feel left behind within their own country and clearly that's where the far right alternative py party with its anti-migration agenda um has managed to really activate um resentment and it's interestingly also where particularly buar um the political leader formerly from the left party which is the successor party of the Communists here in former East Germany um who traditionally still did very well they were a very strong political force I mean in theia in the state of the ringia there was a state Premier from the successor party to the Communist so they they still have shaped yeah um also in a in a positive way how people perceive it as such um the way perceive their own people perceive their own identity and the left party was also seen as a party that particularly represents um the concerns of people in people in the east in the in the new new States as they're called the NOA bunder yeah for anyone new joining by the way we're talking with Mna she's the chief political editor for deut so check the description make sure you check them out and M next question um is about our Channel or my the channel we we run is all about the EU right so of course these are Regional elections or state elections which are quite small compared to the whole of the EU but do you think results like this could have an effect trickle down so to speak on anything on the EU or do you think it's too small for now everything depends on everything I mean if there's something that we've seen over over the last couple of years is that Germany has actually been um has successfully managed to avoid um the kind of right populism going mainstream as we have seen in France for instance or Italy so some can argue this is a trend that's arriving late in Germany at the same time with the historic context I mean 85 years ago today a Germany attacked of Poland Nazi Germany attacked Poland so it's very much a historic moment and a reason for reflection to look back how can it be that a party um whose leader certainly is the ringia can be called the fascist comes out top in Regional elections so it it it feeds further into a trend of populism of uh anti-migration sentiment in Europe and also in the context of um this terror attack that we saw just over a week ago here in Germany where rejected Asylum pment from Syria um uh killed three people injured eight people that really set up a wave of anti-migration sentiments um it panicked the political Center there was suddenly a competition who can be toughest and all dis all differentiation between terrorism Asylum and migration is lost for now in the German debate and it's it's events how the fact that events like these can spark uh such uh sentiment and such political reactions tells us also that um ch change um toward in all directions can happen rather fast and also a tilt towards the right can happen pretty fast and this is now what we've seen in the ringia and this will be something that certainly Germany will be doing a lot of soul searching on right because of the historical context I mean the German press will discuss this very differently from the international press which is um and I think it's completely legitimate and to look at uh also the election Victory here here in uh Saxony where a conservative State Premier is one who has been critical in the past of Germany's support for Ukraine that is a very exceptional position to have for someone who's a leading figure in the German conservative CDU at the same time this is part of what big tent conservatism means here right now now I spoke to him earlier and he told me that he exactly holds the same position as a central party but he certainly doesn't sound the same so there's more openness or there's there's a huge desire to want to find a peaceful resolution with Russia uh here in the East and people here resent that cliche but the polling shows you that and if you speak to people on the street they will um much faster come to the point where they say look but there's also the Russian side you have to listen to the Russian side on it so it's not a clearcut kind of issue and they don't want to get dragged into that so that's what the um government of Olaf Schultz is up against which is just clearly failed um to make any kind of impression on voters in these two eastern states that went to the polls but the short answer is there's no huge title change here it's a historic huge uh title change for Germany for its in internal debate um but it doesn't change the majorities national and we don't have an election system where we're talking about a few states that are particularly important because they're swing States and because of the mass of the election system Germany has a proportional system so what the proportion of everyone in Germany um wants and perceives to be will be reflected in the German the central um bundar the German Parliament and therefore also the government as a whole because maybe also for the audience it's quite quite important to realize because you keep mentioning proportional and the population on on the East Germany is is quite small right compared to the rest of Germany would that be the correct interpretation or yeah yes it's a about just less than a third of people lived in the East right um and that I guess this also adds to the feeling of um not having the political say that um they would want to have I mean I I think this will take some very detailed polling afterwards um and clearly the politicians I spoke to here tonight mainly from the conservative Camp also say that that is the H workk that they are taking away um how to um really address the sources for this uh frustration that is a lot higher in the face of often similar outlooks on um the economy and on living standards and you know there are similar problems actually in east and west where if you talk about the kind of infrastructure for health care in fact if you talk about public infrastructure like roads and trains and everything that's a lot better in the East because it was brought up to standard after reunification so we I guess we also need a bunch of psychologists looking into this there is a huge resentment of not having enough say in how the country is run and I have to say it is true um if you look at um leaders CEOs in Germany leading businesses but also top judges um the East is still underrepresented in that thank you for that very very clear answer we have another question from the audience so Villa is asking thank you for your question Villa can we expect the same results in Brandenburg for the 22nd September elections um in three weeks I don't want to speculate on those but again um there you have a Social Democrat uh run the state and it will also be I mean there the the far right afd party is also polling very strong and it will be a very tight race so the big soul searching will happen after those elections I think it will be very interesting to see how political Berlin reacts these coming weeks until at the 22nd of September when Brandenburg goes to the polls but the the the trend is similar if you're looking at uh at it from the out side there's a similar Trend a level of frustration there and and I'm really curious to see how big the turnout will be because here it was almost three quarters of people that actually went to the polls that's that's really pretty high yeah so maybe I'm just gon to pick on another answer you you mentioned which I thought was very interesting um for example the the Russia issue in and supporting Ukraine financially and with weapons which apparently um well the BSW I know and F they are are against financial support and want to look for a peace uh peace talks with uh with Putin and zeny Etc but if I'm not mistaken on a state level you can't really influence that right isn't that done on a federal level um so how come that was such an issue or wasn't it such an issue it's a lot of questions there yeah it was an issue because that's where the vo of sentiment was I I it really didn't I mean the posters from zaren literally read do you want war or peace as if you could vote for war or peace in these elections okay and um it's and and the uh narrative that um both Zar but also the power at afd party are trying to push is that they are the ones who are calling for talks and nobody else is it's not true we just saw a peace conference in Switzerland we do see efforts from different sides to try and get everybody around a table at the same time if that means the surrendering parts of Ukraine to Vladimir Putin that clearly is a price uh that the far right afd and the left are willing to pay and that's that's a much bigger strategic question whether that could be in the interest of Europe um if you H hand over um a country of parts of a country in Europe to the aggressor so that that that part is always left out um and these are very um consequential and difficult decisions for Germany and for Europe to take and this is something where Chancellor Olaf Schultz is clearly also treading on eggshells within his own party where you have um which traditionally is much more open to to talking to Russia and um the reason he isn't right now talking to vadir Putin is because there's a sense that there's no point right now this this doesn't seem to be a route that is worth taking but talks are always and have always been going on in the background that is something um I heard times times and times again from close advisers both in the foreign Ministry and the chancell very interesting so we talked about that being main issue or one of the big issues people voted on what would you say the other issues are that people voted on migration migration is a key concern yeah and interestingly in the east of far fewer people of a migratory background or migrants than in the west but this is also where social scientists phds have been written on the some sh and that when people don't encounter people with um other backgrounds they fear the unknown um it's not explained that simply though because what is also taking place here in Germany is that many towns are saying they simply are running out of capacity to take in more migrants so bringing those numbers down will be crucial for Olaf schs to stabilize his own Coalition and demonstrate that he has migration under control and with these blood lines I spoke about not bringing these numbers down well in the light of the zingan attack that we saw us over a week ago be seen as being um weak on security so the last couple minutes we have uh Mika um quick if you look at these elections was anything for you like a surprise or was there what what stands out to you in these elections as a general question what stands out to me is that um really big 10 parties um the social Democrats in particular of Olaf Schultz that can really be playing in very different leagues uh regionally and nationally and how particularly this past week it really has been incredible um the sense of panic and speed of turning around um Asylum policies toughening them and demonstrating action we um a a plane with um offenders with uh who of of Afghan nationality sent back to Afghanistan if you'd asked me 10 days ago I would have said there's no way anyone can get this organized in Germany so um that was quite something that probably had an impact here in terms of these elections I guess what does stand out is that the conservative CDU particularly it State Premier here in Saxon M kma by being out in the field speaking to people tirelessly and I don't know how many barbecues he did this time but clear he's been running a a barbecuing campaign has managed to stay ever so slightly ahead of the alternative for Germany and while in the past um the a lack of Charisma didn't seem to be a a factor that rules you out from becoming a leading figure German politics I guess these times are changing as well just leading sorry there's one interesting question i' still like to ask you if that's okay and this is um The Joker and he's kind that's his name but um he mentioned based on your previous answer too is the AF in his opinion the afd and BSW are getting really big because they are anti-immigration and why do the rest of the parties ignore this question this is his opinion is he is he right do you think immigration was the driver and other parties are ignoring it like you mentioned about the SPD Maybe I don't believe that um completely changed so much but the other parties I can I would have given you a different answer 10 days ago but since the alling an attack if one it was like a jolt of lightning um down the spine of the current um governing parties and they are no longer ignoring this issue if they were I they there was an attack also at the end of May after which Asylum laws were also already tightened and attempts were launched to um to change um Germany's weapons laws particularly in relation to knives Germany doesn't have that many doesn't have shotguns PR circulating for it's like the us or something it's a completely different kind of level so I think it's unfair to say that they were ignoring it but they have suddenly discovered that they need to demonstrate action and need to be seen to act even if and I've spoken to many lawyers um experts in the field over the past couple of days real change will take time changing EU treaties takes time but clearly everything seems to be on the table right now with the leader of the opposition Fred mat having called for the government to declare a migration emergency even trying to really um or push European Partners into showing more solidarity they of course are pointing back at him saying look it was your Chancellor from the conservative camp in 2015 who didn't close the borders and took that single-hand decision so without wanting to go into the details of the dysfunctionality of the German Asylum system the issue of migration is something that the parties both now in the current Coalition but also the um the key opposition partner the conservatives have have realized is something they do not want to be campaigning on in general elections that are happening at the end of September next year right so watch this space and watch the next couple of months whether it continues in this kind of pace but what is it you know and I think this is really something um also um where we will be looking very closely um whether this creates a sentiment where plurality and and attracting foreign Talent um will become more difficult for Germany if signals are all um essentially anti-migration and potentially xenophobic on that on that note the final question we ask our guests uh before we B you goodbye Micha is and I know this is a big looking into the ball of crystal ball of what could happen what do you think the Coalition will be in Zakon and what do you think the Coalition will be in turingan if you want to answer of course oh well in Saxony I mean it's it's so early in the night but it looks pretty firm now particular with the left party not having been able um to join the parliament again that um the conservative State Premier M kma will most likely be able to continue as now uh which is in a coalition with the social Democrats and the greens the greens had looked a bit shaky there and uh in the ring year it will be a lot more complicated and it will be worth looking very closely um it's very much pointing towards Zar playing playing a key role there potentially under the lead of the conservative CDU party so whatever you see happening in these two states is a laboratory for a a potential future in Germany where the far right alternative for Germany party gains a lot more track if it doubles nationally that's the scenarios Germany would be facing but now I don't really see the far right afd doubling its support in Germany okay so just to summarize CDU and BSW potentially might play a big role in turingan and in Zakon let me go straight to that view again potentially the CDU greens and SPD again if I understood that correctly awesome M so for everyone again here that uh that hasn't hasn't heard yet so um thank everyone thank M she is the chief political editor from deut chll um we have the link to doll in the description it's great read they got great articles and everything so thank you so much for making it on the live stream if there's anything you'd like to mention to the audience about your about doll or anything like that please go ahead but otherwise I bid you farewell and thank you well if you want to know what's happening in German politics we'll give you the instant analysis because we know the actual people we show you so yeah I appreciate talking to you tonight yeah thank you and have a a good time in the rest of the evening yeah take care bye bye so everyone that was two very very interesting guests so thank you for uh for staying around um we also have Elliot from the EU simple joining us in a minute uh for people that re watch the channel a lot you might know him he did the AI act live stream last week and uh yeah we'll be basically talking a little bit more about some of the questions that we haven't answered yet in the chat and if there's anything else you want to know yeah did you enjoy it first of all did you enjoy these type of guests and um let us know if there's anyone else you'd like on like on in the future um maybe while I have you all here and while I'm waiting for Elliott uh we are looking now that the European Parliament is finally going to get going again next month we are looking to have more members of European Parliament on the live stream so if you like that kind of thing make sure you subscribe and make sure you follow us and we also have a uh have a video um coming out about these elections tomorrow so so make sure you watch that something else I was very interested in uh I'd like to have a look at and that's this so if you can all see the live stream um this is again looking at Zakon and this really surprised me because if you look here you can see the age ranges and you can see that the afd the the right wing far right party in in suon had 31% of young people voting for them which really surprised me because um I wasn't even able to ask the guests but normally you think of younger people being more I don't know leftwing liberal almost um but in this case in in zux they're not and I mean let's have a look at the other ages geez it's all it's 30% everywhere really actually quite funny 70 plus are the ones that uh vote for afd the least which I think is another whole topic by itself maybe worthy of a video uh Sebastian grunfeld makes a really good comment that the afd is doing better um in social media and um I can only confirm that because uh I know oh what's his name again the uh the afd leader in the European Union um um for the uh for the AF what's his name God ah the big guy ah doesn't matter but he made a he made a Tik Tok video which is all about about real men vote far right and if you want a girlfriend vote far right maximan I got him now thank God maximan from the afd he was uh he was very uh very interesting Tik Tok posts you should definitely definitely check them out anyway um it's because the leftist youth left for West Germany is what we um Ibraham said ah with that being said Elliot welcome on the stream hello yes I should be here hello everybody thank you lberto for having me as a special guest yeah you're you're a special guest now from the EU Made Simple yeah uh yeah it's a lot more chilled you know with two EU simple colleagues talking on the live stream it looks like you oh there we go you're not frozen anymore yeah well um I have to disappoint many people though uh I am not a German political expert uh so I can't help much um and also I want to apologize right now because the cameras are once again Square because Google meet likes to make the camera Square for some reason so they look a bit worse um anyways yeah thank you so how how was it lomber just can you can you explain to me what what is your takeaway for tonight about the about these results really in these two interviews well I mean my main takeaways are are twofold really I mean it is I I know that our um political correspondent or the the chief editor mentioned that um you know the the East is is not proportional there's a whole lot more nationally in everything but I think it's it's very very evident how badly the greens the SBD and and the fdp lost the fdp we didn't even talk about cuz they're not even on the picture because they did they did that badly do do we do we have any information on how they did previous elections in uh the Bund bundeslander let's have a look at Saxon let's have a look at Saxon so let's have a look here we go yeah they were already very small anyways yeah uh but this is the 70 plus um let me have a look if I can find it maybe here greens no this can show you where here maybe here's the fullest Al anen there we go it's still not there yeah it'ser it's crazy yeah yeah but considering they didn't make the image um it shows that they've that they lost heart right they lost heart yeah they lost heart definitely and um I don't know maybe you're a bit more educated on this than I am do you have any um let's say clue or inclination to uh I guess maybe specifically for the fdp that they're just non-existent at least in these two uh bundeslander anymore yeah yeah so for everyone here the again the Coalition in Germany for the federal government is um SPD greens and fdp fdp is yellow they're not on here and the reason I mean there's so many reasons why they did badly right but m one the main fdp not I love how you always try to get me to the point um the main reason for fdp not doing well is I think I think they always they feel like the the the sore um the thorn in the side of the of the of the other two you know they're always blocking everything one example is they call the schen B here in Germany so Germany would like or the greens and the SPD would like to make new debt so basically borrow money to pay for expensive green and social programs and the fdp basically says no we're not borrowing nothing so right so so and that that doesn't really play well in the hands of the SBD and greens because they can't do their programs which make them makes them look bad and the fdp looks bad because everyone else is like well we can't do anything because of the fdp so it's you reckon the yeah the general population is thought of this as well that the fdp is generally seen as someone who is constantly blocking the current Coalition and therefore yeah on the European level they're not different right they're blocking the combustion engine ban right at the very end you know they're blocking that they're blocking a supply chain legislation on the EU level so this tiny party in Germany at the moment is blocking stuff on the EU level so they're not well liked yeah I guess not I mean um do you remember how they got into the Coalition like why why was they why were they chosen in the first place um I guess well the SD won the most votes back in21 20 20 um anyway it doesn't really matter the SP W um but they had to form a coalition right so they looked at the greens but even with the greens they didn't get over the the magic number of 50% I not enough yeah so that's why they needed someone else and um well they obviously weren't going to go with the IFD too far right they obviously weren't going to go with the CDU um because of the whole 16 years with CDU um so yeah they went with the fdp and already that doesn't fit well right because the fpd is Center left and then you have the greens who are well the greens also towards the left and you have the fdp who is like liberal sure but very very much against spending against raising taxes you know kind small government stuff like that yeah yeah exactly you got it it's like the vvd in Holland I guess yeah see yeah but I guess I would have to look a bit more into fdp to make a statement on that I they have a they're both liberals right yeah they're both liberals but I mean you know yeah yeah okay but I want I want to get your thoughts on this I was just talking about this while you were gone I mean um look at this here if you look at 18 to 24 31% voted for afd which I thought was interesting because the younger people are normally known for voting left wing normally I guess uh re yeah I think so but yeah that is I think been a change through through all of Europe really that um the the young young people are or I guess yeah 8 8 to 24 young people are more and more right I think not only in Germany this is the case yeah yeah I know it's changing and Sergeant rupt I'm just reading Sebastian grunfeld in the comment he seems like why an expert and he said FTP was chosen because they were the least controversial which is funny because fdp said they would never go into a coalition with the greens I see yeah well what what getting into a like the prospects of getting into a coalition really makes a party think uh like oh maybe we should go back on our promises it's yeah I I feel like uh most of these statements are take you have to take them with a grain of salt when you're in election season right um because that gets your votes right but yeah yeah okay interesting and then I mean I mean we talked about I think you asked me at the beginning like what else stood out and that's the BSW right buness I didn't know them like I am not really following uh German politics that like narrowly and the BSW I I never heard of before so she was a if I got it correctly from the conversation she is split off from the Linker right or like correct correct correct so here let's have a look at her zarag um she used to be part of the left so this is the lady right okay I think I've seen her before yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I have to give her one thing she talks a good talk right I've seen her in like chat shows and or like um TV shows and things like that she's very articulate um she makes she argues well makes her Point very well um and yeah she basically was with the left eight months ago and then formed her own party and called it after her own name that's a bit of a very confident very okay that's a better word very confident thing to do um and she's sitting in what third place in both states which is pretty incredible yeah all right well in third place and uh I believe that she has a strong position for um negotiating into coalitions as well no like there's many possibilities because I see here BSW BSW um yeah but then yeah right sexy looks difficult so zon we're looking at um and the only possibility in zon or the most likely one I guess is C SPD BSW but this they don't see good politic they don't see uh BSW and I guess sday working together or uh BW yeah because why wouldn't for example just like as a dumb dumb question why couldn't you add on the bw2 S sdu and SPD good question actually oh here here it is sorry the first one oh I'm blind as hell okay you are blind as hell I blind yeah yeah my bad okay so with SPD and not with the so yeah the gruna like I'm I'm talking about the Coalition on the the top right of the the m m coal SBD SBD sdu and gruna is it not possible to add BSW maybe it's too many for parties who knows yeah here this is this is actually a good one I've got a really cool page that we can quickly have a look at um this is going into the video we're creating for tomorrow morning okay and have a look at this so oh look okay all right yeah yeah this perfect Yeah so basically here just for the audience everyone this shows the the possible coalitions on the left side so CDU SPD green CDU SPD vsw afd CDU this is not going to happen no one wants to work with afd afd sdbw will likely also not happen or almost certainly because afd like every other body has stated that they are not willing to work together with afd right right right okay and I have my thoughts about that let's get to that in a minute actually sure yeah so here so for example CDU SPD greens sorry it's German and everyone but it just shows you um and these are like stop sign means they can't they they can't work together when it comes to economy first one's economy they um it'll be difficult to work together on migration it will be difficult to work together on kids and um youth yeah but they and they what they can work together on is energy clim climate and Mobility so only one thing they can work together on and look all the combinations have the same problem Jesus Christ it's either only on one they can really work together on and yeah or nothing exactly exactly and these are the Lo know the local issues I mean Russia and things like that I mean that would be a big stop sign everywhere yeah yeah yeah Jesus Christ well that's difficult is um we have uh because I'm personally I'm from the Netherlands we had our elections not too long ago um and many people back then were also thinking like um the biggest big the biggest winner of the election was the pvv right the party of here Wilders most of the viewers might have heard of him um where he won and many parties said well we're not going to be working together with him so the exact same discussion that's going to be held right now is H what do we think of that where the biggest party can potentially not be included into a ruling Coalition um and like this is obviously the bundeslander so a lower region not National but it's the same discussion uh anyways right yeah what do you think actually Ellie let me ask you what do you think do you think there should be a red wall against farri right parties if 30% of the population voted for the farri party you're asking me to yes this a difficult one uh honestly I I've been thinking about this a lot and I think I'm leaning more towards it is okay um and I think a lot of people in the chat might disagree with me on that but I think um like um Mika said it's a proportional system so I think as long as the the the ruling government represents more than 50% of the the people who are eligible to vote then I would be okay with that yeah I wanted I wanted to say as well should we should we ask that in as a poll as well yeah yeah I just I just did so it' be interesting to see what the audience thinks I'm leading more towards it's all right um specifically because it's really I don't really have any let's say objective it's more of a feeling that I feel like it's it's okay as long as the government that is ruling you has voted in by more than 50% of the people I that's my take really yeah yeah yeah I have I also have mixed feelings like how much longer are you going to try and block these parties out right I mean at some point I mean at some point you might not I mean at some point they might if my God I can't talk if you keep blocking them at some point they might win 50% of the vote right and then they are in then they can do whatever they want if you yeah ex I I I'm I'll also on the other side um I would say that you know maybe let them rule um let them rule see how it goes and then I think maybe or maybe not we'll see then maybe most of the people who voted then will decide like okay well maybe this wasn't it we should try something else again because right now I feel like voting is very much based on um how do I put this nicely Vibes is that a like like how how does a person feel um how like I feel angry with the current establishment because of many legitimate reasons so I'm I'm going to vote the opposite of what the current government is right and it makes sense like as a as a human being but yeah so maybe let the AF day go um and then see what happens granted um this maybe won't work if a party is going to be dismantling or uh threatening democracy uh but I I don't maybe I don't know enough about a afd or its current stances how how much of a threat they are to tooc so I can't so I can't com on that I actually think the uh the D the DW Chief editor uh made made a fair point actually and um I mean 30% might have voted for them but 70% of other people also right didn't and they they probably are voting for parties that for a reason of them not wanting to work with the afd you know like people vote for the CDU also because the CDU said will never work with the afd right you know what I mean so it's uh I can see both sides and here one of our patreons Villa is also saying they should never be let ow ever they are a threat to democratic values like you mentioned too maybe they have done things in the past which could lead to that uh there's a there's maybe maybe it's a meme I'm not I think it's not really a meme but um in the in the Netherland right we have um kid wers right now is in the ruling Coalition and um the very fact that at first people really were really scared of of him as a far-right politician um but very quickly he gained the nickname of he milders which roughly translates to boy being more mild um in the sense that he was very he was very um willing to compromise on the hard stance that he took in the past in order to form a coalition so uh maybe it's there's a trend of when a party is going into uh a r government they become a bit more let's say to the center a bit more mild because the very fact that ruling is you have to be a bit more open-minded towards other viewpoints because otherwise you can't rule right right in our systems that is not everywhere but in in I think in Germany and and Inland that's 100% 100% like I you're completely right it's the same in I think Germany obviously uh the greens would have loved to do more green stuffff or green policy couldn't because they made a deal with with the fdp andd to compromise too you know on certain areas right right so yeah like people are saying um if they some people are of the opinion that IFD is of a threat to democracy and I that could very well be I I I guess I haven't followed that enough um so what does the Paul say should afd be given a chance to be in the government uh voted from and most people would agree with that so that is interesting that's very interesting yeah yeah uh Varner KP is asking us what you think will deportation happen fast um so Ellie let me quick explain to you so a big issue here in Germany is that people Asylum Seekers that have been rejected they're not being sent back to their origin quick enough or at all coming to think of it right okay and then for example last week in Z got zaling I think the the city is called zolan Z zolan yeah sorry sorry my apologies um you know the person that killed three people there with a knife attack he was supposed to be deported a year ago I see I see okay so this is a big issue and I think that's why Warner KP is wary KP is asking that um yeah go ahead so um correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like this policy lays on the federal level of deporting people and not with the bundes lender could that be could that be right so yeah so if that's the case then I don't think it really matters too much right now who wins in the in the the local regions uh it matters who is in the the ruling Coalition federally right like nationally yeah but I think yeah go ahead yeah I think you're right but I think what does matter is that they're under pressure now they know if they're not solving this before next year when the elections are right yeah they're going to be penalized for it yeah that's that's probably that's a good point uh so I reckon uh if yeah these with these results I mean these are exit polls right it's still being counted um I think that if this is a big issue and um these people are in Germany illegally and they should like by law be put out then probably there's going to be more money going towards these procedures right towards the the Personnel that's supposed to do this so yeah I guess if this is the case then there will be more deportations um not to say that people who are in Germany legally as Asylum Seekers although some might in might not think that Asylum Seekers are here legally either um those probably won't just be put out because there's many different laws on European level as well where you can't just uh throw people out that you don't like right um so yeah there's are many more questions in comments in chat yeah um kiju I know some of it so if you have a question let us know Boomerang how come the CDU and other parties didn't want to work with the greens um Boomerang is your question about the result from today or is it around the federal government quickly just a I mean OT if you want to answer go ahead but I I can quickly make two comments make your comments I I I'm I'm not the person to be asking these questions to because I'm learning here just as as the audience is so yeah um yeah I mean I can I can talk about the CDU I I mean again not to go too far answering this question but um I think I think the greens have done a lot of policies over the last years that have annoyed some of the vo voter bait of the CDU voter bait of the CDU and I think the most prominent example is um when there was the energy crisis um with with Russia invading Ukraine um and Germany was reliant on Russian gas what did they do instead of what did they do they they they closed down three nuclear plants right that's mainly because of the greens because it's in their in their Manifesto and everything yep um and of course the CDU was completely against this and there's a couple of examples like that I'm just saying one right now and I think they don't the CDU doesn't want to work with the greens because because they've bashed the greens so much over the last four years that um I think they are scared of losing voters if they do work with them and they're just very different different policies especially on energy yeah I got that that um the greens policy of of shutting down nuclear energy really really gets me going sometimes as I I was like I I sometimes can't really put my head around it I like in my eyes the biggest argument against nuclear energy is its cost and it takes very long to build these things I mean if they're there don't just shut him down in exchange for more coal and gas I I don't know it sometimes it felt a little bit ridiculous for me I can't believe it it's like shooting yourself in the foot like yeah can't use gas from Russia oh oh I got a great idea let's turn off our nuclear plant too I mean yeah yeah like even just from a from a yeah let's not get into it that was a bit silly it was a bit silly yeah yeah so um mik Ros proach is I'm not sure if how you pronounce that name he asked what is your opinion on the Slovak government and honestly I don't know much about the Slovak government I I don't hold any strong opinions on the Slovak government I don't know if you have any insight now you're putting me on the spot so Slovak government I mean smear the smear party is the number one there with fito um if I'm not mistaken um yeah yeah my opinion I mean I just did a video on the rule of law and they're not doing great on the rule of law for example um true but okay actually I do have an opinion now okay go ahead you go first true yeah um so okay I'm not afraid to take a hard stances I do not like Mr fito FICO I do not like him and and yeah it's uh I guess he is way too let's say populist swaying to to to whatever the people want to hear um for me to like him and especially his his yeah I'm a big Ukraine supporter that's also I can also say that without without a problem uh so I therefore I don't agree with him either um and like you said the the backsliding with Democratic and press freedoms I think that's also very deplorable so I I guess in general honestly I have to be honest I don't know I have not looked into it much so I can't take an extremely hard sense but in general like the the the news that we get in the I guess International sphere I wouldn't say very positive I'm sorry uh I'm sorry Mr uh Ros Pro I'm sorry yeah for me I mean again like I'm a bit like you is I don't know the depth of it and for me it's also the the Russia Ukraine topic right I think I think it's vital vital issue to be on the right side on um next question by retal why are the pro Russian ties why are the pro Russian ties afd in vag Linka allowed to thrive in Germany go these are these are tough questions I think I I think I have a maybe a beginning for this go ahead um especially because we're talking about East Germany right now I think the policy of the the H the the vand D hle if I'm saying that correctly uh and the general split of Germany because obviously it was under the um Ora pact for most of basically uh the history right now um of the modern state of Germany as we know it of course um is because they have very strong ties to Russia and maybe you have a bit more insight on this the general feel or maybe the the idea of people is that Russia isn't the bad guy as maybe people in Western Germany would have said um 20 years 10 10 years ago I probably that that idea has changed a little bit of course with with current events but um maybe the general side Guist in uh very many German words here in in in Eastern Germany is remaining a bit more positive towards Russia so that's why the parties are allowed to thrive as well right or but you say that Elliot sorry I'm gonna interrupt you but you say that but what I don't understand is Poland and czechia which border Eastern Germany right yeah they they have a completely different stance so yeah so go ahead there is maybe because maybe the hatred let's say um the hatred for for Russians within polish Society um is a bit more there because of a way longer history of rivalry between them being honestly subjugated through most throughout most of their history by or Germany too a few times uh but Russia through most of it as well maybe maybe yeah it's I would know for czechia I would know for czechia I because I'm I'm not familiar with CCH Czech history that much yeah I think just to answer a bit more to that question I think one of the big things big big things that Germany values like a lot of Western countries is freedom speech right um and you know in here every part parties are allowed to say say what they think and if they think that um Russia uh the Russia Ukraine issue isn't um isn't worth sending military aid to or isn't is you when you go for peace deals things like that that's completely fine you're allowed to say what you want here and that's why Germany also allows it to happen like course yeah yeah yeah you're not going to get it or uh yeah no you're not going to get a government saying you know um you can't hold these you can't hold a p the few of Russia simply because they're Russia right yeah um let's say someone corrected me maybe you should be careful what you say other German podcasts were threatened with a 250k uh fine or prison time about about what what should I not say nostro that's interesting I don't want a 250k fine I no I don't want to I I don't think I shut down the channel man that's it's over yeah R Us up man we're done yeah what else do we have um s guys let's just uh wary KP guys let's just imagine somehow IFD won the election in 2025 and what are the chances of they deporting illegal immigrants do you think it's possible this kind of comes down to the question we gave earlier if they are illegal immigrants then it doesn't matter who is there they they are on the way to be deported that's the entire thing of being an illegal immigrant unless you unless you get Asylum or you get citizenship so somehow you're not supposed to be in that country in theory right so yeah because I mean in the German Constitution um it basically says if you ask for Asylum people have the right to ask for Asylum right right so they can come and ask for Asylum that's complete and they're allowed to and we have to give it to them until we we basically say uh yes or no right like yes it's it's valid um and we look after to you or no you don't have a right for Asylum because of reason xbc and then we can of course send them back so that's completely doable but I think it's there's a of issues with like Logistics and and sending it's very difficult sending people back I mean why can you imagine like why would Afghanistan or or first Afghanistan or Syria even talk with us of us sending people back to them yeah um you know it's all very difficult um not saying it's not possible there's always a way but I think that's the main issue of course but like like my answer before if the I wins Big in 2025 then the the amount of resources that go to this process will increase so the amount of people that are going to be put out will increase probably I guess just logically that will follow depending on how could you spend your money and stuff like that but um they will find I I believe they still face the same problems though right they'll still face the same problems I think it's harder done yeah go ahead goad there is there is a uh and um I'm not well versed on the um I don't know the English word for procedur out people but um I don't think in general um I know this about many African countries where if you're supposed to go back they will just put you on an airplane towards that country uh and they will say you're going to get out there and you're not going to be allowed back in to our country so you get your you get your stuff you get put on an airplane I I believe paid by the uh the government that's sending you out and then they put you on a oneway trip to wherever you you came from basically um and and like the other government doesn't really have much to say about that fact because they can't stop that civilian airplane that's coming in and I I say this with let's say 70 70% confidence okay so I might be wrong but that's 70% confidence right there sorry I'm listening to you I'm just reading the comments K is making some interesting points about um the uh uh Asylum law in Germany um K I'm I need to have a look into it um it's interesting
