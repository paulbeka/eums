challenge for the EU and its member states to say the least but while there have been major obstacles and threats the EU has also shown ambition and progress as such this video will look at the top 5 most impactful steps the EU has taken this year and some of the challenges the EU will face in 2023 so let's hear a drum roll for the top 5 EU achievements for this year starting with recovery and growth yes this may sound strange as the EU has been suffering from inflation and an energy crisis but the unemployment rate is actually very low at six percent and the GDP is slowly increasing a lot of this can be attributed to investment firstly Next Generation EU a massive stimulus package of 800 billion Euro that provided grants and Loans to businesses and individuals alike to reinvigorate the economy secondly Horizon Europe a 100 billion Euro investment plan to boost scientific research and innovation in the EU to make it more competitive on the world stage while these stimulus packages were introduced in 2021 they've been coming to fruition this year as you can see in the graph since the covet crisis the EU has experienced economic growth even with Russia's war in Ukraine but sadly it's not all been positive as the Euro area annual inflation was 10.1 in November 2022 but much of this can be attributed to the energy crisis which we'll go into later next up we have our number four which is the final report on the conference on the future of Europe for those who don't know the conference on the future of Europe was the eu's massive project in participatory democracy it gathered young citizens from across the union to deliberate and vote on the most important topics facing the future of the EU in May 2022 the final report of the conference was presented to the three presidents of the major EU institutions with over 45 000 contributions from young people across the continent the final report outlined 49 proposals based on nine topics that should be addressed by the EU in the future one key recommendation was to abolish the principle of unanimity for which all EU member states have to agree in order to take a decision on some political issues and replace it with qualified majority voting there was also support for a common European Army and motivation to make citizen involvement in the EU permanent by running conferences like this in the future the EU has often been accused of a lack of Citizen involvement so this represented a major step forward in European participatory democracy and shows that leaders of the EU are willing to listen to the Youth of the Union next up is our number three going to EU expansion over the course of 2022 a number of countries either joined or applied to join an entity of the EU be it the Schengen area be at the Eurozone or even the EU itself in terms of the EU Ursula thunderline the commission president made it clear that the countries of the West Balkans are part of the European family as a result in December Bosnia and Herzegovina were officially granted the status of candidate country while many reforms are still needed this is the first step towards EU membership as explained in the video linked above there are now eight EU candidate countries as Ukraine Moldova also became candidates earlier this year the visa-free area known as the Schengen area has also got a new member Croatia who will join on the 1st of January 2023. on top of this Croatia will also be joining the Eurozone on the same date the country will adopt the Euro as its official currency and follow the monetary policies set out by the European Central Bank but 2022 hasn't proven completely successful for those wishing to see further European integration Bulgaria and Romania were denied entry into the Schengen this month by vetoes from the Netherlands and Austria despite meeting the requirements of Entry the vetoes have caused Rifts to form between East and West Europe and has angered those who push for deeper ties between the European member states next up is our number two of the year which is the eu's response to the energy crisis with Russia's invasion of Ukraine the eu's gas supply has been massively cut the EOS does taken measures throughout the year to curb the impact of the lack of energy Supply through what is called the repower EU plan we believe the following seven actions taken by the EU were most important a cap on revenues of electricity producers who don't use gas such as wind nuclear and solar a temporary windfall tax for oil gas coal and refining companies whose profits have soared a voluntary electricity reduction of 10 sent throughout the union and a mandatory electricity reduction of five percent during peak hours the gas storage regulation which designated gas storage facilities as critical infrastructure which was Then followed by a goal of filling 80 percent of the eu's total gas storage by November this goal was reached well ahead of schedule with the EU filling storage up to 80 percent in late August joint gas purchasing where 15 of gas storage is filled by EU member states buying guests together this initiative will start next year guest solidarity agreements between member states where countries with excess gas share some of it with their neighbors and most recently the EU has introduced a temporary mechanism to limit excessive gas prices the EU has also turned to other third countries for energy on the 25th of March the EU and the US agreed a deal where the U.S provided an extra 15 billion cubic meters of gas to the EU on top of that the EU and Japan signed an agreement to create a common green hydrogen Market the agreement will help research and develop a more green alternative to fossil fuels and help diversify the Union's energy Supply while the energy crisis is far from Over the EU has so far been able to keep the lights on across the continent before we go to the number one EU achievement of this year we would like to highlight some of the honorary mentions in terms of EU legislation that didn't make the list you might not agree with all of these laws but they were achievements nonetheless and check out my channel for separate videos to explain each of these laws so now we can finally go to our number one most important achievement of the EU this year and unsurprisingly is the EU support for Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022 the Russian Federation launches full-scale invasion of Ukraine though the country is not a member of the European Union nor NATO there's a strong desire from a large part of its population to further integrate into the European sphere of influence develop their democracy and cut ties with Russia this desire was put in full display for the world to see during the euromaiden protest of 2014 also known as the revolution of dignity which saw pro-eu protesters take to the streets Ukraine largely considers itself part of the European sphere so when Russia launches Invasion the European Union immediately began formulating a response strategy to Aid Ukraine's resistance with commission president thunderline stating that ads Europe solidarity with Ukraine will remain unshakable the first steps were taken in the form of economic sanctions designed to Russia's economy in total nine sanctioned packages were levied against Russia from the EU the earliest being on the 23rd of February and the latest one agreed upon on the 15th of December these sanctioned packages included but were not limited to Swift bads for Russian Banks the closure of Russian aircraft and ships to EU airspace and ports heavy economic sanctions against Russian oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and the prohibition of exports and imports of many essential materials Ukraine was also given official candidate status to join the EU after president zielinski made the official application in March on top of this the EU has introduced a temporary protection mechanism so that ukrainians are able to live and work in the EU with no questions asked as of December 2022 over 5.3 million ukrainians have entered the EU according to frontex so these were the top five but not everything has been positive for the EU this year most recently a corruption Scandal has gripped the European Parliament known as Qatar Gates which we covered in a previous video next the EU is facing a serious challenge with its member states using their veto Powers as a bargaining chip most notably Hungary with the eight packages for Ukraine and lastly climate change is an ever-looming threat on the horizon and while the EU is taking steps to combat it there are doubts as to whether this has been enough we plan on covering the main challenges to the EU in 2023 in a separate video so stay tuned these were the major things we believe the EU has achieved this year but this is only our opinion let us know yours in the comments below also a massive thank you for
