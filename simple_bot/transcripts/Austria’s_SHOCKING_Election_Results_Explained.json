And in a stunning turn of events, the \nfar-right FPÖ has taken Austria by storm,   winning the parliamentary election! Their \nvictory, while anticipated by many polls,   has still sent shockwaves across Austria and the   European Union—an institution \nof which the FPÖ is not a fan. Now the real challenge begins: who will end up \nruling Austria? What will the coalition look like?   With no clear majority, forming a functioning \ngovernment will be anything but easy. Before we dive into the numbers, let’s take a \nquick look at how Austrian politics actually work.  Austria operates as a federal \nparliamentary republic.  This means that power is divided between the \nfederal/national level, known as the Bund,   and the state level, known as Bundesländer.\nOn the federal level, the Chancellor oversees   the executive branch, while the parliament \n(National Council) forms the legislative branch.   Together, they are responsible for nationwide \nmatters such as foreign policy, defence,   immigration laws, and taxation.\nAt the state level, Governors lead   the executive branch, while state parliaments \n(Landtage) form the legislative branch. These   state bodies manage areas such as education, \npolicing, cultural affairs, and healthcare,   allowing them to tailor policies to \nthe specific needs of their regions.  Now, this election was VERY significant, as \npeople went to the polls to elect members   of the federal government in Vienna.\nSo, who won, and what does this mean for   Austria and the EU? Before we get into that, \nwe’d like to highlight something important: \"Creating videos like this takes a lot of time,   and releasing them within a day of an \nimportant event like this one means I   need all the help I can get.

Well \nthe results are quite remarkable.  In a stunning outcome, the far-right Freedom \nParty of Austria (FPÖ), led by Herbert Kickl,   surged into first place with 29% percent of the \nvote and 57 seats. This marks a staggering 26   seat increase from their performance five years \nago, representing a massive surge in support.  The FPÖ’s platform is centred around the idea of a \n“Fortress Austria,” pushing for strict immigration   and asylum policies, reinforced border security, \nand initiatives aimed at encouraging the return   of immigrants. Culturally, the party emphasises \nthe protection of traditional Austrian values,   actively opposes what it calls \"gender \nideology,\" and seeks to counter political Islam.  On the international front, the FPÖ remains \na staunch defender of Austria’s neutrality,   strongly opposing NATO membership and any \nmilitary support for Ukraine in its conflict   with Russia. The party also advocates for limiting \nthe European Union’s influence, placing a strong   emphasis on protecting Austria's sovereignty.\nIn second place, the Austrian People’s Party   (ÖVP), led by Karl Nehammer, secured 26% \npercent of the vote, resulting in 51 seats.  The centre-right party has seen a significant \nloss of support over the past five years,   partially due to the fallout from the 2021 \nscandal involving former Chancellor Sebastian   Kurz. Kurz was forced to resign amid allegations \nof corruption and manipulating public opinion,   with accusations that he and his allies misused \npublic funds to buy favourable media coverage.  The ÖVP advocates for conservative values, a \npro-business agenda, and strict immigration   controls. The party supports lowering \ntaxes and proposes a five-year waiting   period before immigrants can access full \nsocial benefits in Austria. Additionally,   the ÖVP is pro-European Union, endorsing \nAustria’s continued integration within the EU and   maintaining a positive relationship with the bloc.\nIn third place, the Social Democratic Party of   Austria (SPÖ), led by Andreas Babler, secured \n21 percent of the vote, resulting in 41 seats.  The SPÖ champions social justice, fighting \npoverty, and reducing inequality through   strengthening the welfare state and \nexpanding public services. For instance,   they propose gradually reducing working hours \nto a 32-hour workweek and introducing a legal   right to specialist doctor appointments \nwithin 14 days. While the SPÖ is pro-EU,   they are firm advocates of Austria’s neutrality \nand strongly oppose any move toward joining NATO.  In fourth place, NEOS, is a centrist liberal \nparty led by Beate Meinl-Reisinger, secured   9 percent of the vote, resulting in 18 seats.\nNEOS presents itself as a forward-thinking reform   party, aiming to steer Austria back on track after \nwhat they describe as \"lost years of crisis.\"  They are strongly pro-EU, advocating for \ndeeper European integration. Interestingly,   their manifesto mentions support for a \n\"Joint European defense\" — emphasizing   an integrated European defense system based on \na highly skilled volunteer army. As for NATO,   NEOS has not explicitly called \nfor Austria to join the alliance.  In fifth place, The Greens, a left-wing party led \nby Werner Kogler, secured 8 percent of the vote,   resulting in 16 seats. However, they lost \nsignificant ground in this election, a trend   that has been mirrored across the EU recently.\nThe Greens are focused on making Austria   climate-neutral by 2040, aiming to achieve this \nby massively expanding renewable energy sources   and phasing out the use of fossil fuels. On \nmigration, they promote a policy of \"humanity   and order,\" which includes creating legal pathways \nfor refugees and speeding up asylum procedures.   The Greens are also pro-EU but remain supportive \nof Austria’s traditional stance on neutrality,   refraining from advocating for NATO membership.\nThere are also smaller parties, like the Beer   Party, which we've covered in an entire \nvideo linked above, and the Communist Party. However, these parties didn't \nsecure any seats in the Nationalrat,   as they failed to pass the 4% threshold \nrequired for parliamentary representation. Wow, these election results have really \ncomplicated the path to forming a government   in Austria. Since no party secured the 92 seats \nneeded for a majority, a coalition is essential.  At the time of recording, there’s \n4 viable option on the table:  A coalition between the FPÖ and the ÖVP.\nA coalition between the ÖVP and SPÖ  coalition between the ÖVP, SPÖ and NEOS\nOr a coalition between the ÖVP, SPÖ and the Greens  For option 1, unlike in many other countries, \nthe conservative ÖVP hasn’t completely ruled out   working with the far-right FPÖ.\nHowever, the 2 leaders   really don’t like each other.\nÖVP leader Karl Nehammer has ruled out working   with FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl, citing his extreme \nviews and tendency to embrace conspiracy theories,   for example on issues like climate change. \nBut, he has also acknowledged that the FPÖ is   a diverse party with many reasonable members.\nThe ÖVP already governs with the FPÖ in three   Austrian states, and given their similar views on \nimmigration and economic policy, this coalition   remains a realistic possibility. But we see this \nas unlikely, as long as Nehammer and Kickl are   the leaders of their respective parties. Either \nof them would have to resign for this to work.  For Option 2, a coalition between the ÖVP and \nSPÖ remains a possibility, but it’s too close   at the time of recording. They currently meet the \nmajority threshold by just one seat, a margin that   could shift as more results are counted.\nHowever, the SPÖ, led by Andreas Babler,   represents the left wing of the party, and his \ndemands—including a wealth tax, rent freezes,   and a pilot for a 32-hour workweek with full \npay—are largely incompatible with the ÖVP’s   conservative platform. There are instances in \nthe past, where the ÖVP has chosen to partner   with the FPÖ rather than the Social Democrats due \nto such stark ideological differences. This can be   seen in several regional coalitions, including \nin Lower Austria, Upper Austria, and Salzburg.  As for the third and fourth options, they face the \nsame issue: the ÖVP and SPÖ have stark ideological   differences, and adding a third party only \ncomplicates things further. A fragile three-way   coalition could easily backfire, creating \ninstability that might boost the FPÖ’s popularity   in opposition, potentially setting them up for \nan even stronger showing in the next election. So, which option will prevail, and who will \nbecome chancellor? It’s still too early to say,   but option 3—with an ÖVP chancellor—seems \nthe most likely outcome for us.  But - what do you think is the best coalition?
