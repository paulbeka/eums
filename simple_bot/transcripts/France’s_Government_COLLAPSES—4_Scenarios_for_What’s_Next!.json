    "transcription": "We are back with a video about France… Because \nthe French government has collapsed. Again!  This time, a dramatic vote of \n“no confidence” sealed its fate,   with the National Assembly tallying \n331 votes for and 246 against. If you’re wondering why French politics \nfeels like a soap opera, it’s because the   National Assembly is split into three main \ncamps: The Far Left to Left-Wing faction,   New Popular Front (NFP), co-led by the \nfiery and ever-outspoken Jean-Luc Mélenchon.  The Far-Right National Rally (RN), commanded by \nthe formidable Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bordella. And the Centrist coalition Ensemble, \nhelmed by President Emmanuel Macron.  Each faction is armed with \nits own vision for France,   and none seem willing to compromise, leading to \nthe collapse of yet another French parliament.  So, what happens now? We’ve identified \n4 possible scenarios. But first,   let’s rewind and break down how we got here. Earlier this year, after a disastrous \nperformance in the EU elections,   President Emmanuel Macron called \nfor a snap election for the National   Assembly—the French Parliament.\nIn July, France went to the polls,   and the results were clear: a deeply fractured \nassembly with no absolute majority for any party. After weeks of infighting and negotiation, \nan agreement was finally reached. Macron’s   party teamed up with the republicans to form \na centrist-conservative minority government,   with reluctant and unstable support from \nthe far-right National Rally. Michel Barnier   was appointed Prime Minister, leading \nthis fragile coalition. While this   setup kept the government afloat for a \nwhile, it was always seen as temporary,   as the far-right had leverage to \nbring the government down at any time. Just three months later, Barnier faced his \nfirst big test: the French budget. For years,   France had been spending far \nmore than it earned in taxes,   pushing its deficit to over 6% of GDP—double \nthe limit set by EU rules. On top of that,   France’s debt has skyrocketed to alarming \nlevels. To put it in perspective,   France’s debt stands at around 110% of its \nGDP, while neighboring Germany is at just 60%. These numbers aren’t just a problem for \nFrance—they’re a major concern for other   European countries. Many fear that if France \ndoesn’t get its finances under control,   it could trigger another Eurozone \ncrisis, destabilizing the entire EU.  To address this growing crisis, Barnier \nunveiled a bold plan: €40 billion in   spending cuts and €20 billion in tax hikes, \ndesigned to inject €60 billion into France’s   struggling state coffers. But such a proposal was \npredictably unpopular in the National Assembly.  Barnier sought to secure support for his \nproposal but struggled to find a majority,   even after making significant \nconcessions. Thus, to push it   through, Barnier invoked the controversial \nArticle 49.3 of the French Constitution,   allowing him to pass a social spending bill \nwithout a parliamentary vote. This decision   sparked outrage—particularly on the left, which \nimmediately called for a vote of no confidence.  The left had attempted no-confidence votes \nbefore, but never got majority support. You see,   Le Pen has previously said that her \nparty will not back such motions,   but last week appeared to change her mind and \nsaid that her MPs may vote in favour after all. Very bad news for Barnier, and of course Macron.\nIn a bid to save his government,   Barnier held crisis talks on Monday with Marine \nLe Pen, hoping to secure her support—or at least   her neutrality. Despite offering several \nconcessions to address her concerns,   Barnier’s team accused Le Pen of \nrepeatedly shifting her demands,   reportedly presenting up to 17 \ndifferent versions of her conditions.  The night before the vote, Barnier made \na last-ditch plea on national television,   appealing directly to the French people and \nMembers of parliament and urging unity to   avoid political chaos. But it wasn’t enough.\nYesterday evening, the no-confidence vote took   place, with X votes in favor and Y against.\nThe result: the collapse of the minority   government and, most likely, the end \nof Barnier’s time as Prime Minister. Le Pen’s true aim, many believe, is far bigger \nthan toppling Barnier. Her real motivation?   Forcing President Macron himself—the centrist \nembodiment of everything she opposes—to step down.  Here’s the thing: the French political system \noperates on two levels. The government, led by   the prime minister, handles domestic day-to-day \naffairs, while the president holds a powerful,   overarching role. That’s the real prize Le Pen \nhas her eyes on. After three failed attempts at   winning the presidency, she’s gearing up for \nanother shot in 2027... Or maybe even sooner.  So far, Le Pen has stopped short of directly \ncalling for Macron’s resignation but hasn’t   ruled it out. “Our constitution is clear,” \nshe said on Monday. “In the event of a serious   political crisis, the president of the republic \nhas three options: dissolution of the government,   reshuffle of the government, or resignation.\nBut let’s break this down. Dissolution   isn’t possible right now, as the French \nconstitution only allows elections once   a year—the earliest would be July next year. \nReshuffling the government? Very difficult,   given the fractured state of parliament \nand the deep divisions between the three   main camps. That leaves option 3, which \nis what Le Pen is clearly hinting at.  And public sentiment seems to back her. \nA poll released earlier this week by   conservative outlet CNews found that 62% of \nrespondents believed Macron should resign if   Barnier is ousted. Among National Rally \nsupporters, that number jumps to 87%.  But Macron isn’t budging. Speaking on Tuesday \nevening, he was defiant: “I was elected twice by   the French people. I am extremely proud of this, \nand I will honor their trust with all my energy   until the very last second of \nmy term to serve the country. If Macron doesn’t resign, his most \nlikely move is to attempt a government   reshuffle. Here are his four main options:\nFirst, Macron could reselect Barnier as prime   minister, despite his government just collapsing. \nWhile unconventional and controversial, this is   technically allowed under the French constitution. \nBarnier would need to appoint a new cabinet,   but it’s almost guaranteed that he’d face \nanother vote of no confidence immediately,   putting the government back in crisis.\nSecond, Macron could appoint a Prime   Minister from the Left. With the New \nPopular Front (NFP) holding the most seats,   Macron could try appointing someone from \nthe left. However, this seems unlikely.   The NFP’s candidates have struggled to gain \nenough support in the past, and any leftist   prime minister would face enormous challenges \nmaintaining power without major compromises   from both the NFP and Macron’s coalition.\nThird, Macron could attempt to appoint a   politically neutral, technocratic government. This \napproach would aim to focus on expertise rather   than ideology. But with parliament so divided, \nsuch a government would likely collapse quickly,   as no side is willing to cooperate for long.\nOr fourth, Macron could try to Build a   Centrist Coalition by bringing together moderate \nfactions from the left and right. For example,   the Socialist Party could use this as an \nopportunity to distance itself from the   more radical France Unbowed faction. However, \nthis approach risks alienating Socialist voters   who oppose Macron, potentially pushing \nthem further toward the far-left Jean-Luc   Mélenchon. A coalition this diverse would \nalso face huge challenges staying united.  So, these are the options on the table. But \nlet’s be honest—each one seems unlikely to   succeed. At this point, it’s anyone’s \nguess where things will go from here. France’s political crisis is causing big problems \nfor the EU, and the main issue is debt. Investors   felt hopeful when Michel Barnier became \nPrime Minister and formed a government   that could manage the budget. But now, after \nBarnier was removed in a no-confidence vote,   fears about France’s debt are growing.\nIf far-left or far-right parties gain power,   their expensive policies could lead to \neven more debt. This could trigger a   European currency crisis, similar to what \nhappened in Greece after 2008, especially   since Germany is also struggling economically.\nThis crisis couldn’t come at a worse time. Ukraine   is losing ground to Russia, Germany's \ngovernment has also fallen, and Trump   is coming to power. The EU desperately needs \nstrong leadership and currently it has none.  But what do you think will happen? \nAnd what is your favorite option?  And we also have a cool video here \nabout the recent Irish elections,   which had a surprise result!
