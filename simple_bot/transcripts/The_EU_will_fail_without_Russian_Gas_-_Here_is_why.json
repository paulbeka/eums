    "transcription": "due to the ongoing war in ukraine the eu has been discussing further sanctions on russia most notably to stop buying oil and gas latest estimates show that the eu spends 362 million euros on russian oil and million euros on gas every day putin's war machine could be slowed down significantly without the source of income but is this even possible or would this result in massive power outages in european homes in this video we will look at russian gas specifically and investigate how big the eu dependency on natural gas really is gas represents around 22 percent of the eu's primary energy consumption and a whopping 32 percent of energy for households and where does most of this gas come from you guessed it russia have a look at these numbers from acer it shows how much russian gas each eu country uses finland and latvia both import over 90 percent of their gas from russia which kind of makes sense as they are russian neighbors however even at the heart of europe countries such as germany italy and poland get over 40 percent of their gas from russia this translates into huge numbers in 2021 alone russia supplied around 1700 terawatts of natural gas to the eu so i think you get the idea the eu is very reliant on russian gas now let's imagine we stop imports tomorrow what would happen thankfully the winter is almost over and the eu generally holds enough gas in reserve to survive for a couple of months but sooner or later the eu will have to deal with a massive shortage of 1700 terawatts per year there are three ways to address this problem the first we increase supply of energy within the eu the second is the eu increases imports of energy from abroad and the third is to reduce the gas usage within each of the eu countries be aware that this next part is very theoretical and is based on short-term solutions and i'm oversimplifying a very difficult problem so please take the following ideas and estimations with a pinch of salt oh and please subscribe and like the video if you're enjoying what you're seeing thank you starting with supply how can the eu bolster domestic production hypothetically if we ignore the politics the eu can do the following holland for instance can increase their gas production in groningen some gas-fired power plants could start running on oil the decline of coal power generation can be reversed solar panel deployment can be doubled and germany could delay closure of its nuclear power plants again most of these points might not be politically possible next is imports from countries abroad hypothetically the pipelines from norway north africa and azerbaijan have enough capacity to supply europe with another 650 terawatts obviously this is an overly optimistic assumption as this calculation does not consider price production capacity and supply to other countries then there are imports of liquefied natural gas also called lng which can be imported without the need of pipelines theoretically the eu has facilities to handle an estimated additional 1000 terawatts per year but this is unrealistic global liquefication capacity is almost fully utilized at 5000 terawatts and producers are unlikely to break their contracts with long-term customers if not for extortionate prices but let's assume that europe is able to grab five percent of global supply in the short term 250 terawatts so can we curb all of eu's demand just by increasing supply according to these calculations no not in the short term at least we are missing 436 terawatts this means that the eu also needs to decrease the demand heavy users such as the industry sector will be hit first governments could force non-critical industries such as steel plants to shut down in emergency situations this has already happened to aluminium smelters last winter who were offline due to unusually high energy prices similarly commercial and office buildings could face a reduction in heating another option is energy conservation for consumers like you and me for instance governments could pay households to turn down their thermostats ever so slightly during the winter there will also be indirect curbs in demand due to energy prices skyrocketing this means that many households would not be able to pay for their heating all in all in the short run it would be incredibly difficult to manage without russian gas the eu is just too reliant and the situation is so much more complex as what i have explained today for one i have assumed the eu responds as a single entity but it's much more likely that each country will fight for themselves this means that finland and latvia will be hit much harder than countries such as spain furthermore to keep things short and simple i have oversimplified the energy market and focused solely on the short term and ignored many of the politics but what do you think should we turn off the gas nonetheless or should we phase it out a bit more slowly to manage the impact let me know in the comments you"
