Bordering France, Germany, Luxembourg, and\nthe Netherlands, Belgium lies at the geographical and cultural heart of Europe. Its unique location has made it a key player\nin European trade, politics, and history, serving as a bridge between the Latin and\nGermanic regions of the continent. Belgium, with a population of 11 million people,\nis divided into three regions — Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels. As a trilingual nation, it recognizes Dutch,\nFrench, and German as official languages. It is here, amid the intertwining lanes of\npolitics and culture, that Belgium hosts the headquarters of the European Union and NATO,\nasserting its position as a cornerstone of international diplomacy and cooperation. So, how did Belgium join the EU to start with? This is the 4th video in a series where we\nexplore each of the member states, one by one. This map shows Belgium before it became an\nindependent country in 1830. Back then, it was part of the United Kingdom\nof the Netherlands and was often called \"the battlefield of Europe\" because big, powerful\ncountries frequently fought wars there. At that time, the southern area was populated\npredominantly by the Flemish and Walloons, who were mainly Roman Catholic—a stark contrast\nto the Protestant majority in the north. This religious and cultural divide fueled\npolitical dissatisfaction, as the south grew increasingly resentful of King William I's\npolicies. They believed: he favoured the Protestant\nnorth, governed autocratically, and marginalised the Catholic Church. These deep-rooted grievances among the southern\nprovinces coalesced into the Belgian Revolution of 1830, which resulted in their secession\nfrom Dutch rule and the birth of an independent Belgium. After Belgium's independence, the divide between\nthe French-speaking Walloons and the Dutch-speaking Flemish endured. Despite their joint effort against Dutch domination,\nthe differences in culture, language, and economy were stark. Industrializing rapidly, Wallonia began to\noutpace Flanders, causing the Flemish to feel undervalued by the nation's elite, adding\nto a sense of frustration and neglect. But more on this later. By the late 19th century, Belgium was riding\nhigh on its industrial success and colonial ventures like the Congo. But its neutrality was more of a 'suggestion'\nto Germany, who barged in during WWI. That invasion was a tough lesson for Belgium,\nand it pushed them to champion teamwork among nations afterward. Post-WWI, Belgium took some new German-speaking\nterritories and even added German as their third language. They tried to team-up with France and the\nUK for protection, but when WWII rolled around, Belgium declared itself neutral - hoping for\na pass. Turns out, Germany wasn't too keen on reading\nthe 'Do Not Disturb' sign and marched in again, occupying the country for four long years. After the devastation of World War II, Belgium\nswiftly embraced international collaboration to ensure peace and stability. In 1945, Belgium joined the newly formed United\nNations, contributing to a global effort to safeguard peace. This marked the beginning of Belgium's deep\ncommitment to multilateral diplomacy. Soon after, Belgium became a founding member\nof NATO in 1949, entering into a collective defence pact to counter the growing tensions\nof the Cold War. On the economic front, Belgium was instrumental\nin European post-war recovery and integration. It was one of the six founding nations of\nthe European Coal and Steel Community, the EU predecessor, in 1951, laying the groundwork\nfor economic cooperation and regional stability. In the mid-20th century, Brussels emerged\nas Europe's political capital, a development attributed: to its central location, enduring\nneutrality, linguistic diversity, and the robust support for European unity within Belgium. These elements collectively established Brussels\nas the administrative heart of the EU. However, since Belgium's independence, the\nrift between Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia has become more pronounced, mainly\ndue to linguistic and cultural differences. But there are other reasons too:\nAs Flanders' economy has surged past Wallonia's older industries after the 2nd World War,\nfriction has arisen over the financial support Flanders provides to Wallonia through social\nwelfare. Politically, Flanders seeks greater control\nover its own affairs, which conflicts with Wallonia's wish for centralised national governance. These disputes over finance and autonomy have\nled to some in Flanders pushing for more independence, while Wallonia generally advocates for a unified\nBelgium. Despite these challenges, I believe Belgium\nis an amazing example of diverse cultures and languages coexisting, with its people\nworking and living together in a vibrant and dynamic society. Regarding Belgium' economy today, its GDP,\nat 554 billion Euros in 2022, is high compared to many of its EU counterparts. With a GDP per capita of 47 thousand euros,\nit ranks 8th in Europe—ahead of Germany and France but trailing Austria and Finland. Notably, with the EU average GDP per capita\nat 35 thousand euros, Belgium is much better off than the European average. The most important sectors of Belgium’s\neconomy in 2020 were public administration, defence, education, human health and social\nwork activities (22.0%), followed by wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation\nand food services (17.7%)followed by industry (16.4%). The EU Single market has been very good for\nBelgium, as Intra-EU trade accounts for 65% of Belgian exports. In the EU the main recipients are Germany\n(17%), France (14%) and the Netherlands (12%) and outside of the EU the UK (8%) and the\nU.S. (7%). In terms of imports, 62% comes from EU Member\nStates, but this time the Netherlands leads (17%), followed by Germany (14%) and France\n(10%). From non-EU nations 7% comes from the U.S.\nand 5% from China. So, are you ready to dive into Belgian politics? Hang in there, because you're entering one\nof the EU's most complex political landscapes. Belgium doesn't do things by halves — it\nhas not one, not two, but seven parliaments! Most countries are satisfied with a single\nlegislature, but in Belgium things are done differently. And amidst all this, there’s still a king\npresiding in the background... Let me try and explain: Belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy,\nwhere the country recognizes the king as its ceremonial head of state, symbolising national\nunity, while the prime minister, who is the head of government, wields executive power\nsupported by a multi-party system. The decision-making process is spread across\na sophisticated three-tiered structure designed to accommodate Belgium's diverse linguistic\nand regional composition. Firstly, the federal level, where the government\nretains authority over national and international matters, including defence, finance, and the\nmajority of social security concerns. Secondly, the community level. Here Belgium is divided into three linguistic\ncommunities, each with their own parliament: the Dutch-speaking Flemish, the French-speaking\nWalloons, and a smaller German-speaking community. These communities have jurisdiction over cultural\nissues, education, and matters related to the well-being of their constituents, allowing\nthem to tailor policies to their linguistic groups. Thirdly, the regional level. Belgium comprises three distinct regions,\neach with their own parliament: Flanders in the north, Wallonia in the south, and the\nBrussels-Capital region. These regions exercise power over territory-specific\nissues such as the economy, employment, housing, and transportation. While the federal government oversees the\nbroader legislative framework, these regions and communities operate with considerable\nautonomy, making decisions that directly reflect the needs and interests of their local or\nlinguistic populations. This complex structure ensures that governance\nin Belgium is responsive to the country's multiple identities, allowing each group a\nvoice in shaping its own destiny while maintaining a coherent national policy. Belgium's Federal Parliament consists of two\nchambers: the lower house, the Chamber of Representatives with 150 seats, and the upper\nhouse, the Senate with 60 seats. Within the Chamber, there's a colourful mosaic\nof 12 parties. Seven form the current government, while five\nsit in opposition. The government's heavy hitters include: the\nSocial-Democratic, French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) with 19 seats, and the Liberal,\nFrench-speaking Reformist Movement (MR) with 14 seats. In opposition, the Conservative Nationalist,\nDutch-speaking New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) leads with 24 seats, followed by the right-wing\npopulist Vlaams Belang (VB) with 18. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo leads this\nmultifaceted seven-party coalition, a government birthed from a record-breaking 500-day negotiation\npost-2019 election. Keeping this coalition united on crucial policies\nhas been an immense task for De Croo. Amidst these political acrobatics, the Vlaams\nBelang party has gained traction and are now leading the polls, championing an independent\nFlanders. As Belgium approaches the June elections next\nyear, this rising tide of populism could signal a major shift on the horizon. On the continental level, Belgium holds 21\nseats in the European Parliament, the same number as Portugal, Sweden and Greece. To put this into perspective, Germany, the\nmost populous country, has 96 MEPs, and Malta, the smallest, has 6 MEPs. Belgian MEPs veer much more towards the right\nside of the political spectrum than other member-states: 4 MEPs are part of the centre-right EPP Group. 2 MEP’s are part of the centre-left S&D\ngroup 4 MEP’S are part of Renew Europe Group\n3 MEP’s are part of the ecology-focused Green Group 3 MEP’s are part of the soft eurosceptic\nECR group 3 MEP’s are part of the right-wing eurosceptic\nI&D group 1 MEP is part of the Left group And 1 MEP is a non-attached member Belgium's reach within the EU is evident at\nthe European Council, where currently Charles Michel, a Belgian, is the President. He guides discussions, builds consensus among\nEU leaders, and helps shape Europe's policy direction and strategic decisions. Furthermore, Belgium is represented in the\nEuropean Commission, where Didier Reynders is the Commissioner for Justice. In his position, he focuses on crucial areas\nsuch as personal data protection, compliance with EU laws, and judicial cooperation among\nmember states. But do the EU and Belgium get along? In short, yes! In terms of public opinion, the Eurobarometer\nin Spring 2023 revealed that 45% of Belgians held a favourable view of the EU, while 22%\nexpressed a negative stance, aligning with the European Union average. Belgium's pivotal status in the European Union\nis undeniable. This is due to its deep-rooted dedication\nto European unity and its strategic position at the heart of the continent. As one of the six founding members of the\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor to the EU, Belgium has been instrumental in\ndriving forward the vision of a united, peaceful, and prosperous Europe. The capital city, Brussels, is often referred\nto as the \"de facto capital\" of the EU, as it is home to important EU institutions, including\nthe European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament. This reflects Belgium's enduring influence\nand its role as a hub of European politics and decision-making. Belgium is known for its multiple languages\nand for how it manages its diverse cultures, which is really what the EU aims to do as\nwell—bring people together while also respecting their different backgrounds. This makes Belgium more than just another\ncountry in the EU; it's a prime example of what the EU stands for and an active player\nin making the EU work well, pushing for nations to work together closely.
