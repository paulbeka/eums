Well, under Prime Minister \nViktor Orbán's leadership,   Hungary has faced criticism for its handling \nof judiciary independence, media landscape,   and allegations of discrimination. These \nconcerns have led to such significant   democratic backsliding that a study by the \nNGO Freedom House concluded that since 2010   Hungary has witnessed such a democratic decline, \nthat it can no longer be called a democracy. The European Union has taken action by freezing \nover 30 billion euros in EU funds designated for   Hungary and presenting a list of essential \nreforms that must be implemented before the   funds are released. Naturally, this has \nprovoked a strong reaction from Orbán,   who has set out to obstruct EU \ninitiatives whenever possible. For instance, one of the European Commission's key \nproposals revolves around allocating 50 billion   euros to Ukraine and commencing EU membership \nnegotiations with Ukraine in December. However,   this hinges on unanimous agreement among all 27 \nmember states, requiring the approval of each.   Hungary, on the other hand, has already signalled \nits intent to potentially veto this decision,   a move some perceive as a form of leverage,in \nother words blackmail, to unfreeze EU funds. This standoff has already happened \nbefore. In December last year,   Hungary used its veto power to \nblock aid and arms to Ukraine,   as well as a minimum corporation tax rate of 15% \nfor companies across the EU. However, once the   EU unfroze a portion of the funds designated \nfor Hungary, the country withdrew its veto. This game of cat and mouse is \ncounterproductive and cripples   the EU’s ability to respond to \ninternational crises quickly. So, what can the EU do in response? Well, the EU has a potential solution \nin its toolkit, called Article 7,   often referred to as the \"nuclear option.\" \nThis measure involves suspending a member   state's voting rights within the EU, effectively \nlimiting its ability to influence EU decisions.   This would mean that Hungary could no \nlonger obstruct key EU legislation. So how does this work? The process begins with the European \nCouncil, where the heads of state from EU   member countries must collectively assess and \nreach a consensus regarding whether a member   state is persistently breaching EU values, \nsuch as democracy and the rule of law. Once   unanimous agreement among the European Council \nmembers is achieved, Article 7 can be initiated. Subsequently, the matter proceeds \nto the European Parliament,   where a confirmation of the breach \nrequires a four-fifths majority vote.   Once the European Parliament confirms \nthe breach, Article 7 can be invoked,   resulting in the suspension of the member \nstate's voting rights within EU institutions.   This process underscores the EU's commitment to \nupholding its fundamental values and principles. The European Parliament even voted in overwhelming \nfavour to start this process in 2018 and in 2022. So why has this not already happened with Hungary? \nWell, Hungary has a key partner in crime: Poland. Under the governance of Poland's ruling Law \nand Justice Party (PiS), there has been a   consistent alignment with Hungary in defending \none another on the EU level. Both countries,   often sharing similar views on issues related \nto national sovereignty and EU values,   have worked together to resist \npotential sanctions and measures   stemming from concerns about democratic \nbacksliding within the EU. In practice,   this means that any attempt to trigger article 7 \nfor Hungary will just be blocked by Poland's Veto. But things have changed. The elections held in Poland on October 15th \nmarked a significant setback for the Law and   Justice Party (PiS), which secured only 194 \nseats. And their potential coalition partner   scored a mere 18 seats. In response, the main \nopposition, Civic Coalition, led by former Prime   Minister and ex European Council President Donald \nTusk, along with the Third Way and the Left,   have joined forces to form a coalition government \nto remove PiS from office. Collectively,   they hold 248 seats, granting them the majority \nrequired to rule and shape Poland's future This marks a remarkable victory \nfor politician Donald Tusk,   as his leadership  and strong EU profile is great news for \nthe EU, as his government is poised to   uphold EU principles concerning \ndemocracy and the rule of law. What about Hungary? It goes without saying \nthat this is bad news for Orban. Without Poland's   support, Hungary runs the risk of losing \ntheir voting rights within the European Union. Or do they? Enter Slovakia. Following the recent Slovakian elections on \nSeptember 30th, Fico, the leader of SMER,   a social democratic and left-wing populist party, \nsecured victory. His election campaign included   pledges to halt military aid to Ukraine and \ncriticism of sanctions on Russia. Fico's leadership may steer Slovakia closer to Hungary, \ndistancing itself from the unified stance on   supporting Ukraine that the EU and Western \nnations have aimed to uphold. Furthermore,   Slovakia might fill the void that Poland has \nleft behind and become Hungary's new partner   in crime when it comes to defending \none another when facing Article 7. Here is what we think. The fundamental \nquestion is whether the EU should even   attempt to trigger Article 7 against Hungary in \nthe first place. It's a complex dilemma. Orban   could exploit his inability to vote in the EU as \nammunition to further criticise the organisation,   especially given his control over the media in \nHungary. This could potentially shift Hungary   from being one of the most pro-EU countries \nto a Eurosceptic one. On the flip side,   waiting until the Hungarian elections in \n2026 carries the risk of significant damage,   as the EU might encounter obstructions at every \nturn. Not to mention, Orban might win again. From our viewpoint, it's becoming increasingly \nevident that a multi-tiered Europe might offer   the most viable solution. In this scenario, some \ncountries would engage in deeper integration while   others take a more restrained approach. \nThis would imply that Hungary remains an   important EU member but must undergo reforms \nbefore ascending to a more integrated EU tier.
