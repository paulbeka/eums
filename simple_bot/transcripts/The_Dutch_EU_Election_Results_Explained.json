    "transcription": "The Netherlands is the first country to kick \noff the EU elections' four-day spectacle,   and the first results are in! According to \nexit polls, the far-right PVV hasn't taken the   election by storm. In fact, they were pushed \ndown to second place, with GroenLinks/PvdA,   a left-wing green alliance, securing the most \nseats with 8. The PVV party secured 7 seats,   followed by the centre-right VVD party with 4 \nseats, and the CDA and D66 with 3 seats each.   The rest of the seats go to the following parties.\nBear in mind that these are exit polls,   which are usually quite accurate, but \nthe official results will be announced   on Sunday evening after all countries \nhave voted. So things could still change.  So how does this compare to 5 years ago? Well, the \nPVV remains the biggest winner, gaining 6 seats as   they weren't able to secure more than 1, 5 years \nago. The biggest loser is another far-right party   called Forum for Democracy, who lost all their \n4 seats. As for the rest the changes are quite   minimal, with a maximum shift of 1 or 2 seats.\nLet's look at the situation at the European   level. First, we'll exclude the \nparties that didn't secure any   projected seats. This leaves us with ten parties\nFor those unfamiliar with the European political   structure, there are seven main political \ngroups in the European Parliament. Dutch   parties are affiliated with these groups, \ncollaborating with counterparts from other   nations. Here's the breakdown for the Netherlands.\nA quick note: VVD's membership in Renew Europe   isn't certain due to their cooperation with \nWilders in the national parliament. Similarly, BBB   and NSC still need confirmation for the EPP group.\nBut let's assume their affiliation stays,   then the totals would look like this, meaning \nthat Renew Europe and the I&D group are the   winners of the first elections.\nSo what did we learn?  Firstly, there's no right-wing surge! Let's look \nat the 2019 election results per European Group.   Yes, the far-right I&D gained 6 seats, but the \nright-wing ECR lost 4 seats, meaning they only   netted a gain of two seats together. Considering \nthe number of seats in the Netherlands increased   by two, it's not a massive gain. Wilders may \nhave won the national elections by a landslide,   but it looks like he might lose this one to \npro-EU factions. Let's see if this trend holds.  Secondly, voter turnout increased by 5%. Yes, \n46.8% is still way too low, but maybe this is   a sign that EU election participation is on the \nrise. Obviously, we are going to take FULL credit,   all thanks to this EU related channel!\nThirdly, it is all to play for. 31 seats   have been filled out of 720, meaning there \nare 689 to go. Remember, these are just exit   polls and things might still change.\nNext up, Estonia, Czechia and Ireland.  If you like this content, please like the video \nand subscribe.
