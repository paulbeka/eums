as much as me and lambertus did lambertus what are we doing today well I mean what else can we do right it is the EU EU elections my God the US elections last night and uh I honestly didn't think we'd be sitting here talking about the results and that they're finished there we have a winner I thought we have a winner in three days yeah that's what I was thinking as well that we would be waiting here for a while and we would be speculating tonight and um or fortunately in our case I guess we could talk about actual results uh today even though some might not like them yeah so Elliot what happened is I got up at 400 a.m this morning had a whole video prepared for a kamla Harris and and Trump literally you know neck on neck saying oh where could the states go literally open my computer I'm like oh [ __ ] I have to restart and lambertus um you know that I that I love you dearly okay but you look tired as well okay yeah I am TI you look a little you look a little tired I am tired I am tired I don't know how it is with the people in the chat but I was one of those people I couldn't sleep I just had to watch the elections until like 1 or 2 am. and then I slept for like two three hours what about you yeah I mean I watched till about 1 um and then or I I watched the half past 12 went to bed and then took out my phone anyways to look at the elections instead and till about 1 and I was like I got to sleep I'll see you tomorrow morning and then I woke up at 7 looked at my phone I saw that Trump won and I was like I'm going to go back to bed but I couldn't go back to bed anymore I was like I I have to think about this now what happened yeah yeah I don't know I was um I I was I mean let me get into it right I mean here we see we see the map Elliot and um I honestly thought I don't know maybe before we even look at the results I honestly thought Kam was going to take it I don't know I was very I thought the the female vote would come out I thought the high turnout would be good for a I thought the swing states were looking in our favor Iowa for example I I really thought she'd take it but I was so wrong I mean what about you I mean yeah you were wrong but if it's any reconciliation you weren't the only one that was very wrong I I guess we um we spoke about it a little bit but all the pulsers that are being paid to do their job um were rather wrong I just want to just flat out wrong I mean everyone got a little bit if if you're a Camala supporter Kamala I think we should say it properly Kamala supporter we you will be very excited especially about the news with the recent polling about you know winning in gy swing States but that didn't end up coming true so yeah especially this one where is it Iowa God now here here Iowa so there was a poll on the weekend that showed Kamala literally winning Iowa so when I heard that I was like dude Iowa that's like the most reddest State there is and um if Kamala is leading in a poll there it looks very good for her and then look at it Trump smashed her so I really wonder like where did this come from wishful thinking or was this more false in the polling itself I I really don't know where this came from where where there was like even talks of Texas becoming a swing state or at least swing state territory and nothing nothing really worked let's look at Texas Trump took about 1.6 or 1.5 million votes I mean wasn't even close let's be honest the whole election wasn't close no it wasn't close at all both popular vote and the Electoral College is decisively in Trump's favor so yeah New New Jersey I think NJ is NJ New Jersey New Jersey where's New Jersey here we go New Jersey yeah 51% yeah it's also still pretty close yeah but Elliot Elliot let's let's get into the CR of them sorry know I like let's get into the Croc of the what why did if you had to give two three reasons why Harris lost what do you think were the were the key reasons that's a very difficult question um let's Okay the the Twitter argument let's say let's say the more social media argument is that people believe that she is somewhat of a Dey pick a a she didn't respect or she didn't get elected for anything was the one of the main one of the main talk no policies you mean right no no like more in the sense that um the main critic was she didn't go through the regular process of her going through a uh the Democratic um H God I forgot the name for this where yeah yeah yeah exactly thank you um where they go through the the regular process that she gets chosen no she was the criticism was she was pushed forward so that was probably most of the uh criticism coming from the Trump side so I don't know how much actually that affected her vote however I think we saw in the results that most of her um the the Latino base and lots of uh black male voters they did end up going for yeah this is probably a good like most of them um like you would expect a way larger come out for the Democrats but that didn't happen at all and I feel like a big part was that the so so-called flyover states were a pretty much left ignored right where like they only the swing states were were focused a lot but that didn't in the end it didn't matter for her I mean like these are these are really good stats I mean maybe let's first look at these before looking at the swing States because uh basically for people watching this is the exit polls on like what people voted for I mean more or less yeah uh and here you can see I mean I mean white white people 43% for Harris 55% Trump I mean that kind of expected right a little bit yeah yeah and then black black 86% uh Harris and 12% Trump so that's pretty pretty good for her where did she lose I mean she lost the white the Asian and Hispanic the Asian Asian and Hispanic vote is the one where she was expected to do way better than she did and that's a very large part of why she uh why she did only got 53% here right that's probably problem supposed to be way bigger um I forgot the stat let me see if I can look this up real quick because um you know what I think is hilarious I mean it's only 1% but she didn't do well with the American Indians only 35% doesn't she have like an Indian Heritage no she doesn't sorry not American Indian sorry I apologize yeah what what do you mean what she has her either her father like one part of her family is uh but is it American Indian or is it or just Indian Indian exactly I don't know in any case we have a we have a great uh Super Chat for if you might have missed it by politics for fun he donated €2 saying snap elections in Ireland what's your opinion um I me go ahead go ahead go ahead yeah uh this is a American live stream right now we we're discussing the but in any case I have no idea what's going on in Ireland so I I I didn't even know there were snap elections coming so that's very good for informing me very very hot news thanks politics for fun but um we are most likely do a video on it so subscribe if you like it but uh for now we're going to focus on the US so if anyone in the chat has questions on the actual us tag us and if you really want to answered then definitely use a super chat so thank you so much yeah um maybe let's look on the list again a bit further yeah anything else interesting I think uh Trump did pretty well more expectedly so with young people as well where where the normal trend is that young people would vote Democrat a lot of them did vote um yeah from from from 18 18 to 29 a lot of them voted almost equally so in for Republicans you see this is what I don't get right I mean look at this the women what I have thought in this election is that this whole issue with abortion right which is a massive thing um topic obviously because the Republicans are being very aggressive in um in legislating abortion and I thought the woman vote I mean yes young women they voted for Kamala here look at that 45 plus only 50% of them went to Kamala that's crazy it's it's still there's still a large hold out for Republican women I I guess these would mostly come from the the red States but yeah the the issue of abortion is a lot more let's say less clear for them than for younger women women yeah crazy crazy I mean I'm Gonna Keep On scrolling down let me have a look here so where did Trump dominate okay obviously Republicans uh what was that was that without college degrees white non- colle graduates yeah yeah white men right white men white mon College yeah I think big part of is the anti- wo culture right so lots of young men don't liking not liking the woke wokeness in the world they the woke virus yeah yeah that's a very big thing I mean I think this kind of speaks to a very large Trend in general in American politics Maybe even Western Politics as a large where it's all very Vibes based let's just say that what doesn't feel good is going to make you f vote uh to hell with with anything uh on paper what doesn't feel good um is is is going to be leading and I think and I'm a little bit biased here um I think that really showed during this election yeah yeah I mean I read okay this is another interesting stat right that um apparently one of the big reasons some people voted I mean which makes sense is democracy right trying to defend democracy that was big reason but apparently you know and if I hear that I think oh that's probably good for the Kamala Harris vote but apparently a lot of that PE those people that voted for democracy also voted for Trump because they had the impression that Kamala and the Democrats were bad for democracy which I think was I mean maybe I live too much in a bubble but to me it was only really Trump that denied denied an election like like he did like a couple years ago yeah when I when I saw those stats I was thinking the same thing where in well obviously it can go both ways you can interpret it both ways but in general you would say that is most likely favorable for camela so this like the these stats came out at what was it like 11 uh C in the evening uh yesterday or like at 12 as so I saw that I was like okay it's looking a little Democratic um but yeah that didn't end up coming to fruition man yeah yeah yeah I see a lot of comments as well yeah I see do you have any let's go to the chat is there a good question from the chat Elliot uh well we have politics for fun following up his question with saying what should be eu's next step after Trump's win I think we can get into that um in a little bit because um we uploaded a great video obviously go watch it if you hav haven't yet about the six main um effects on the EU with the Trump Victory uh what we have we have Johan Yan SED if I pronounce that correctly what's next with Ukraine and I think that's a a very big topic as well is there a chance that Trump will leave negotiations with um Putin uh so I think that all goes into the topic what's going to happen to let's say Europe so if you want to shelf that for now maybe we can we can talk about that a little later or you can tackle them now as well if you feel like it yeah maybe we we talk a little bit more about the actual election and then we definitely go to the whole uh the whole effect on the EU because there is six big points six massive points that will change in the EU or what I think that will change in the EU so we'll definitely look at those but I don't think we're quite done looking at the results not yet not yet okay so so for every oh we just got another Super Chat by Billy Oldman uh they ask is there a recorded trend of American politics shifting European politics that's a very good question actually I love this question I think it's a very good question and I've been think yeah I've been thinking to do a video about this actually because I have looked at populist parties and things like you know populist parties right-wing populist nationalism that that kind of thing before Trump took power in 2016 so I really looked at the amount of seats in the European Parliament the amount of governments in the in Europe that had you know populists part of the government and there is definitely a correlation of fewer at least the 10 years before Trump got power of those types of parties and politicians in power then there were after Trump elected for his first term whether that's an actual correlation to Trump I mean that remains the question right I'm not sure but what do you think do you think there is a correlation without like without looking further into this topic I I can't say I I would want to say it probably doesn't help or help in a sense that um if if a leader a populist leader a little a very popular leader is elected in one country um the population of Another Western Country might say hey it's going pretty well or that guy is elected so let's try to do the same in our country I think that you could probably make that argument definitely but um I think so yeah but didn't wers sorry to interrupt you Ellie didn't wers in Netherlands so Wilders is won pretty much won the last Parliament election in the Netherlands and he's also like quite farri populist but wasn't one of his slogans like um Netherlands first right nland of nor a in Dutch I think wasn't it some some something like that I mean I feel like it all kind of Blends together all rhetoric with putting your own country first that is that is a I think a very generic sling slogan for most of these type of parties but to finish my answer I yeah I think um there's a very possible chance of what you're saying is correct on the other hand maybe this a bit more uh coping or a a hoping in that sense is that um some are like really calling now for well you know see um the United States is uh choosing their own path so to say and when are we as Europe are going to stand our own two feet when are we going to decide to not be dependent on who sits in the American White House for our own policies right I think that's a very uh very interesting question is is is even though you could argue that we've had this wakeup call in 20 2016 maybe even in uh 2022 with the invasion of Ukraine and now again so you CH start wondering how many wakeup calls does Europe need in order to stand on its own two feet but yeah what are your thoughts Fritz like Fritz just said in the comments make make Europe great again right yeah make Europe great again or make Europe great because I don't think uh a proper European identity has never really been I mean that that's prevalent in in in the EU I think not an identity but but I want to maybe maybe just pick out another comment because Villa here I mean I always pick on him why because he's a commissioner on patreon so we love asking those questions here so thank you Villa for being a patreon so he said to me it's shocking how well Trump did in popular vote first time a republican wins popular vote in 20 years and the best Republican result in New York since 1988 let's actually go back to the map and see what he means oh yeah yeah there are some historic results in this election that just breaking records really um which should really come to a slap in the face to any Democrat leader out there they should really start changing their stuff up okay this is really embarrassing where is New York where is somewhere here right no no it's the big NY at the top of the screen oh [ __ ] that's really embarrassing my bad okay anyway so anyway so 700,000 here for uh Donald Donald Trump no that yeah that's still great great for him yeah yeah great I mean that is I mean he's I really would like to pick on this the popular vote I mean 2016 Hillary smashed Trump in the popular vote 2020 Biden smashed Trump in the popular vote and now for the third time Trump's got four million four million five million more popular votes I mean yeah and the crazy thing is the the popular media in in in um like CNN you know CBS I think is one of them in the states they all mentioned Trump has like a 48 % roof he can't get higher than that because no more no you know that's it's the max he can get well they were wrong yeah I I haven't heard of the the roof yet I didn't I didn't hear that before or read that before at least yeah mean that's what they mentioned like in the popular vote when it comes to that 48% is like their their the roof I mean maybe I'm talking talking [ __ ] but that's what I remember hearing on one of those one of those no no no it could very well be I mean there was quite a sizable portion of undecided voters I even up up until going up to the ballot yesterday that probably just went for Trump and why they went for Trump I think that's going to be showing quite soon in all of the research and all of the stats that are going to follow out of this election but yeah the rhetoric has been very very effective I guess in state of the economy because that was one of the largest I think the second largest of uh the key issues people voted on right like uh 33% % state of democracy 31% economy if I'm not mistaken jeez and immigration do you know what was immigration immigration was either 13 or 11% so it was a lot lower yeah it was a lot lower than expected below abortion 16 I think 16 that's still lower than I expected to be honest yeah yeah democracy and economy well I mean isn't that the agel saying of it's the economy stupid that keeps being repeated I mean yeah crazy crazy I mean yeah it is what it is I mean another thing maybe Elliot uh how let's like L before we get into like what it means for the EU like let's have a look at the battle states right the Battleground States sure because you know at the start of the night you know Geor okay maybe for people that don't know very very quickly Georgia South Carolina uh Michigan Wisconsin Nevada and Arizona those are the batt and Pennsylvania my God the big one right here yeah the biggest biggest upset yeah seven states seven Battleground States and so far five out of the seven and the the other two will likely also be called went to Trump that I mean did that surprise you or what do you think about that I mean that's quite remarkable isn't it to me it's surpr to me it was definitely surprising I mean I'll be honest this is like the real like the first real us elections that I'm I'm I'm thoroughly following because otherwise I couldn't just be to to be frankly couldn't be bothered but right now when I was looking at those go and especially around the the the reporting around it and the polls I mean it was always going to be close but you know this big of an upset yeah I didn't expect it at all and I don't think many people expected it either yeah do you think explain why do you think there's a uh I mean I mean if we go back to the reasons why do you think it's because Harris had a bad campaign and the second question is do you think Biden would have done better I mean I when the when the discussion was there of if Biden should drop out yes or no a few months ago I was one of the people that were saying that I think it might be more beneficial for Biden to stay in because you know the incumbent is always expected to run right it is it is almost unprecedented that the incumbent gives up in favor of a new candidate I heard he super pissed by the way I heard he's really pissed I can imagine he probably they're watching with his wife is like these D oh these damn Democrats took it from me yeah no but like in all honesty would he have done better we will never know I guess but I don't think he necessarily would have I mean when Harris came as the the new candidate there was a certain wave of enthusiasm a wave of positivity of like more youthfulness and a more a lot more let's say trust and I feel like that was like the only only way the Democrats could have won and if Joe Biden would have stayed there in the same old you know I don't even know in what state I am currently um then I don't I don't think they would have squeezed it out anyways right yeah yeah no I think so too I think Biden was toast I I I watched that debate you watched it probably too right against Trump yeah yeah yeah and I almost like it I almost felt like after that debate it was so certain that he would uh that he would replace at least I thought so and I almost felt like Trump was upset that he lost that badly because he's like oh damn he's so easy to beat why did I take him down like that yeah yeah yeah but this is the thing as well with um with these debates is there it's always the question of how much do they really matter because honestly when as an outsider looking at the Harris Trump debate I I felt the same embarrassment that I felt for for for Biden for Trump at that at that moment like what what is this guy still still doing here I mean talking about eating the cats and the dogs I mean like come on and yeah we should also probably address the another great ah super chat chat go ahead this one's yours that oh this is mine okay so yob thank you so much we really appreciate it he's from the Czech Republic I see the biggest change is seen at the county level or the county level yes y anything outside the cities has always gone to Republicans the US faces bigger problems than Trump so maybe let's take an example right let's take one of the Battlegrounds uh which one do you want Pennsylvania that's I take Pennsylvania yeah so as jaob says as you can see the cities they're still blue though I mean I can't click how much they are but yeah and the country is red um which is completely true so yakob maybe to clarify your question what what do you mean you're saying that the the the cities are changing that the cities are also becoming Republican because that might be true proportionately but so far the cities are being won by Democrats let's have another look yeah yeah I think in general the cities are yeah this has been a a fact is all this time but maybe in a few few cities that it wasn't the case I I'm I haven't gone down to the county level I'm if I'm honest with you so uh but so far it still looks true that but this is the thing right and this is what kind of annoys me too um I remember two days ago or was it three days ago it doesn't matter but Kamala Harris was having like a uh a rally and there were all these stars there I think not not Beyonce but anyway some some stars and like making a massive show out of it and I'm thinking okay that's cool for the people that can attend the rally from like the cities or wherever she's doing them but if you're like in the countryside and then you're seeing the money being spent on these R these these these crazy rallies with all I mean Trump's doing the same I guess but still I'd be like it's so obnoxious almost right so elitist no I mean I don't know think no I I disagree with that because this Showmanship these celebrities all of this is just like I would almost say integral like like nature to American politics and especially American elections is of this these ground showings these uh these big stages always filled with people getting these endorsements out of everyone like this is I think this is a a TA as old as the American elections themselves so I I don't think this is necessarily the problem I want to ask you though and maybe this is the the unspoken an elephant in the room right how much okay I just got to be a bit proactive here how much of this loss has to do with Harris being a woman oh big question okay so the crazy thing is I think if I'm not wrong and chat please correct me she did worse than her uh than um than what what's her name umary Hillary Clinton right so yeah I think she did so in that sense I I don't know I mean oh God this is a very difficult question so so she I don't think she okay put it this way firstly I don't think she was the best candidate I think she was better than um than Biden but I think the Democrats would have been would have done better if they identified earlier that Biden wasn't the right candidate and just went through a typical primary you know let the best battle against each other we have Shapiro who was he's a very strong candidate and then in California you have new he's a very strong candidate you have though sorry is it new like very controversial I wouldn't go new either I wouldn't even go for someone in California California's Democrat anyway I think you know Shapiro what state is he again I think she he's from a red State somewhere in the in the rust B may I don't I'm not sure I I okay anyway but I'd rather you know rather go for one of one of not rather but I'd rather go through a primary um why two reasons firstly these candidat get a lot of media attention so everyone knows who they are and secondly is you normally get the the right candidate to to then position against the Republican candidate right kind of but I mean obviously I don't have to explain to you the the circumstances the unusual circumstances that this this election went through right I mean like I said the incumbent is supposed to run and there was so little time to still or at that point decided especially after that uh after that debate that going through a regular primary would just was a lot of time and leave very time for why did they wait until the debate I mean everyone okay not everyone but not every yeah yes there were there were def obviously there were definitely signs that it was not going well with Biden but the general unspoken rules remain that the D incom is supposed to run and I mean honestly Biden didn't Biden didn't do that awful uh throughout his throughout his presid presidency so it wasn't that Unthinkable of him running but you know when his I mean I I don't know if I can call it legally dementia but his his absent mindedness was shown all on live television for everyone to see then he can't really go back at that point anymore yeah yeah I I see your point but still I don't know I mean it seemed a bit strategically I I think earlier would have done them a lot more favors yeah but it's very easy to say the hindsight is it not hey I should be the I should be the Democrat strategist strategist whatever you call it yeah oh we have another yakob is on Y is the same yakob I think I think it is is it let me check yeah yeah yeah I think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh yakob I'm gonna try and pronounce yacob's last name because I feel like we owe it to him yakob shavan shik uh that's what that's the best guess that you're going to get um they say there is a huge problem in the US where the countryside is rapidly becoming poorer and less important and by that I mean the whole Countryside except for the big cities the US is rapidly becoming ex except for the big cities the US is becoming poorer okay yeah I I I think I think he makes a good point because um so much I mean look at the Rust Belt right so if we look at uh here is it here Detroit for example that used to be like the manufacturing City for for cars back in the day I mean I know I think they still they definitely still produce but it's nowhere near the scale from before and just a lot of and also around Detroit right it gives a lot of jobs to the countryside around it and they can go and work there and I mean the countryside itself yeah that's probably poor too I I guess but and it's and it's also so I'm going to continue on the rant now but I think it's also the social system or the the The Winner Takes all system in the states right I mean here we have a lot less inequality in Europe than in the states and we're doing a lot more against inequality than the states too I mean what's your opinion Elliot that was just my the thing is is that um isn't this I don't know a trend always is that Countryside is poor and and cities are richer like to me this isn't a very big relevation exactly I mean Yona said sorry sorry Start interrupt you yonas in the chat the big companies are in this are normally in the cities especially with the new tech companies right yeah those those companies and those cities are the ones that are the the producers of of all the um let's say the the end of the supply chain which adds the most value to the American economy and those cities are making America so unbelievably rich as it is wasn't California like the fifth fifth largest economy in the world just the state California something crazy like that yeah so California is like the fifth or sixth richest country in the world yeah yeah if it were if it were a country so yeah but but in the case are they getting is the um the the Divide getting bigger I think I think so um but I would have to I would have to look into the numbers a bit more to be confident on that all right okay so let's let's switch topic maybe one more question from the chat and then let's go what this means for the EU so um let's have a okay is there any question uh let's scroll up a little bit here um okay I could scroll up quite a bit pest says check the blue wall States yeah so I just did I think so here Wisconsin yeah Michigan so here maybe very quickly if you I mean you can check this yourself of course too but Wisconsin geez that's close that is close to be fair so okay Trum just won it Michigan also just won it but jeez he won all of them Ohio oh do you remember during the night at the start Ohio looked likely to go to Kamala and I was literally when I went to sleep I was like oh this look good I didn't look at Ohio I think I went to sleep at that point already oh but then then she lost it and Pennsylvania that's the big one right yeah no literally I I woke up I looked at the I looked at the map and I saw like Trump is like how many electoral votes away from winning I was like okay this is [ __ ] I threw away my I threw my phone and tried to go back to sleep yeah yeah anyway Elliot yeah go ahead goad go sorry yeah so I mean all of these results are nice and dandy but the real interesting question of course is what do they mean and most importantly what do they mean for us as humble Europeans because that is what I care about is me myself and my fellow Europeans only who cares about the Americans you know what I hate OT what I really honestly what I hate is a strong word but I do actually hate it is the dependency that we have to this to this country I mean look at us we're having a live stream about another country that's not even like near to our own continent talking about the results because we're literally like oh what does it mean for us that's how much how much dependency we have on the states which I think I mean what do you think I don't think that's the right way forward I think you you put it very well in your uh in in our last video is that that we as Europeans are almost dependent or um so dependent we are dependent on the wi of a few thousand voters in some some key swing States just rid to me it's ridiculous um so yeah how crazy is it like yesterday night I'm thinking oh I really hope those 20,000 people in Pennsylvania will vote this way or that way you know how crazy is that how czy we have another uh Super Chat by HHH PPP uh donating $24.99 air o r n and starting with an R so I'm instantly thinking of something REM Ian I'm not sure which currency that is so I apologize but they ask do you think that Trump will weaken or make the EU stronger so that's probably a good way to kick off our our discussion on this yeah go ahead oh is it for me okay so for both us God so I think okay I think it's it's a difficult question so I think in the short term it will definitely not be in the eu's favor at all I think it's uh it will be very very difficult why and I mean there's six reasons I mentioned the video I'm just going to mention two very quickly and that's firstly um defense I think defense is a major issue uh especially because of Trump's you know skepticism towards NATO and also of course Ukraine and the second reason is economy why Trump wants to put tariffs on every country importing or exporting sorry to the States on all good exactly 20% exactly and who's the most powerful exporter in Europe it's Germany and Germany's also the richest country in Europe and they're already in recession almost now they're going to be screwed by this so I mean for me the short term I think no it will definitely not make the EU stronger but Elliot to you what about what do you think what about the longm longm long term long term um it is i' I saw a few articles po pop up about this just uh just a few days before the election as well is that there is a general theory I'm going to call it that this quote unquote shock to the EU system will force it once again in some way somehow to stand more on its own two feet and I think that there is definitely a small part of that that is true that there is a uh core of Truth to the argument saying that we can't be riant on the United States and we can't be sitting on the edge of our seat every sing every four years hoping that there's going to be a candidate in the white house that is beneficial to us Europeans I think that there's a that you can make a good argument there um now the second question of about that is are we going to translate that fear or that shock into actual actions that is the the second question and I that is the place where you can where we can start debating because I'm not sure and I'm leading more towards maybe we aren't going to be the most successful in that regard yeah um what is your long-term view on this then oh you're making it's it's it's again it's a very difficult question but I mean what what the good thing the EU let me restart many of the countries in the EU see Trump as an almost like an enemy right like a threat not all the countries by the way um so that sometimes having a common enemy will Resort into people baning together right countries baning together to do something against it however foreign policy in the EU as probably most people know requires unanimity right what does it mean it means that all the EU countries if we want to have an EU response need to all say yes and I agree with that um and that's just not it's just not happening in the EU because there's some countries and I hate to always point it out but Hungary Orban for example he Lo he not loves is a strong word but he was very happy with the Trump win and he will not go with foreign policy decisions that the EU might make to try and counter Trump for example or to integrate further so for example if integration is your is your cup of tea um and there are certain countries and leaders that just don't want it so long term will the EU become stronger together because of trump ah I don't I don't I'm I'm skeptical I have to be honest I I kind of hope so because I think it is a threat but I think there's certain countries that will hold us back okay let me put it this way then um I think probably but but if it doesn't then I'm I'm pretty pessimistic about our our future as as Europeans then if if if like if something like this doesn't make us move then I like honestly I'm not sure what will in in the end like does does it really need to be the case that I don't know in some hopefully unattainable future that a Russia has to invade a European state or like an EU State I mean not European geographically or like what needs to happen for us as a as a group of countries to wake up and see well you know my GDP and population of Belgium yeah is not going to be boxing up anytime soon against China or or a United States right so in that case I I really hope that we take this lesson and say okay guys I know we have we've had our multiple wakeup calls so maybe it's time to do something um but for me the big one's defense I just yeah I just think uh I almost like don't like the arrogance I mean arrogance might be the wrong word but like literally the EU I mean I'm going to be very harsh you might disagree with me here you know we we get so we pay so many taxes and we are so generous in all our social benefits everyone gets their safety now which is fine and but then the arrogance of being like Oh but the U and the US will protect us so let's just all not pay anything for our defense you know and that we've done that for decades you know it's just it's just ah it's just so blind if you ask me it's just so okay so yeah the peas dividend what we're talking about now I mean it once again I think a large part of this plays into being able to uh have some hindsight but honestly the thought of having a stable world order a a world order under the uh United States was a very real thing especially after after the fall of the Soviet Union um when there's a so-called uh us hedony this is the real idea that many countries in the world world had is okay well I mean United States is our quote unquote World Police we can spend all our all our money on nice things and whatever happens you know the United States that's the big dog we're going to listen to it and now let's say up 20 years later 25 years later that is no longer happening we are being brutely awakened by the fact that there are multiple countries in this world that don't necessarily agree with the way the United States is running the world running the world is very broadly put but let's say uh their world order and now we're like well damn I guess we do need to pay a little bit more for our own security this this is what I mean like it's a it's a bit blind saying that almost I mean not you but just generally oh we don't agree with America being the World Police blah blah blah and I get it especially with Iraq and all that that might have been a step too far but in the end we also have to recognize that we've benefited massively by just being under their defense umbrella no no I listen I this is no this is no shade at all because honestly it is a I I believe that it is a bad development for the entire world is that we are now once again becoming fraction fractionalized people are going to their own camps and we're all spending a lot more on defense because in an Ideal World you know if you don't have to build tanks you can you know spend it on whatever economy education kids starving whatever and that's a utopic I know obviously this will be an Ideal World and this probably will never happen but yeah if if there is generally Global Peace and a a general stability of under one uh let's say military superpower there are def definitely big benefits to that and now everyone's forced to spend money on defense again and not that I'm against it because I I is as any person probably in this is chat can see that we need do need this security spending right now because frankly we need we have to defend ourselves yeah we have to and I do worry I mean um I mean if we go look at the effects on the EU right so we've mentioned NATO right NATO is a big issue we've mentioned I think the first the second one we should probably talk about a little bit is Ukraine yeah Trump clearly mentioned that he wants a deal as quickly as possible and I emphasize deal not a peace deal because any deal that he will make will probably be Putin getting I mean this is my opinion Putin getting what he wants and Ukraine probably not in the best position or uh getting the best deal out of it probably have to give out giving up land giving up NATO like that um yeah because without the US money that's literally their their money for next year will almost half so big big big issue yeah so that's probably the one of the biggest things that are going that are going to be impacted that we as Europeans are going to be impacted by is the decision of Donald Trump to do go either way well it's we don't know I mean Joe Biden is still in office for a few months uh two and a half let's say um and then he's going to have to transfer his power over to Donald Trump and at that point I mean he has promised us there will be a peace in 24 hours wasn't it something like that 24 48 Hours yeah yeah the first day so I'm very curious to see how that is going to be entail what is that going to be entailing I wanted to uh highlight a comment real quick from the live chat sure um there was a user Sailor Mercury says the world felt more peaceful during Trump Trump's first term no Russia Ukraine or Israel Palestine not nonsense and I feel like this I wanted to highlight this because the word felt is a very crucial part in this comment the world felt more peaceful because it wasn't more peaceful it only felt like it because these these uh conflicts are getting a lot more air time and are generally a lot more bigger um as impact wise but you know Isis was still very much going on Syria was still much very much going on Iran was bombing s Sai places so it wasn't more peaceful it just felt like it so I I just wanted to say that also the drone strikes under Trump were I think second most under any President Obama I think even more more than Obama more than Obama he killed that Iraqi General yes slani exactly which also might have got the conflict rolling that we have today yeah the embassy from uh Tel AV to Jerusalem ement exactly exactly yeah I mean it's Ukraine or the crier was still occupied the war in the war in dobos was still raging so uh I mean honestly the audience could fight me on this but it wasn't necessarily more more peaceful it just felt like and here The Loft do Europe was more peaceful I mean CRI Crimea in Ukraine got invaded in 2014 that was under under Obama right and and then two years later it's not like Trump did anything against it either so so in theory Europe was already at War since 2014 so I I don't know I don't think it's uh I object I mean from Far like a high level yes you're right there were more Wars that are being reported on at the moment but I don't feel safe I definitely don't feel safer with Trump as the US president as a Biden for examp I mean and also the biggest I guess the biggest uh foreign policy mistake ever is stepping out of the nuclear uh deal with Iran that is just giving Iran a free pass to create a to nuclear weapons which I mean depending on which intelligence agency you subscribe to they are basically there having a nuclear weapon so yeah yeah and I also want to mention here red zap is commenting also I I want to reply to that so defense spending is there EU is the second highest defense spender in the world even more than China but it's not too scattered uh you make it sound as if the EU count is not spending enough well two two replies to that some countries definitely are not spending enough Italy is way below 2% Spain is way below 2% Portugal so there's plenty of countries that are not spending enough and to be honest sorry one more comment okay I'm gonna rip in a bit more sorry not rip in but bit more Germany has only spent 2% this year in the first time in like two three decades so there's a lot of catching up to do but he is right the spending is there but the problem is we have a lot of catching up to do and the second thing is it's dispersed completely dispersed we're not buying together we all have our own planes our own t our own headquarters Etc and that is we lose incredible economies of scale which is one of the reasons I mean if we work together in Europe on anything defense and foreign policy for me would be the number one but sorry Ellie you wanted to say was it I I think I think that was the what the user was alluding to is to that like we are like right now we are spending uh quite quite a lot but the the amount that we're spending is not being allocated efficiently I think maybe that was more the the argument that they were going for but sound as sp's not meing enough but too scattered okay yeah you're right so Jeff so redep sorry it's too scattered he's right there I think so too okay yeah yeah I just wanted to say that we had a a nice graphic on our e simple Instagram account where it was like it shows like from a few years ago to now the amount of Defense spinning to GDP so you can see that like I want to I would have to pull up the the graphic again but it was like I think four like almost four or five are only below the 2% of GDP that we agreed upon with NATO right uh Poli F says Instagram is very nice I like it good good data and I agree politics are fun what a pH say it as well right now the average is exactly at 2% yeah yeah yeah it's a good but exactly like you said it's it's a start but I mean we're just spending 2% for one year you're not going to be fixing the massive massive structural you know deficit all of these militaries right you need you need multiple years of this at least yeah I mean even building certain military structures takes like five years I mean aircraft carrier I think it take the US take like eight years or something like that but we're not going to be making aircraft carrier I'm not saying we should I'm just saying that's how long it would take yeah yeah yeah no yeah you're right yeah uh in any case I also wanted to look a little bit about um I we've we talking about the EU a lot but I I wanted to look a little bit about Trump's policies as well for the United States itself um and I just kind of wanted to get a feel about what you thought and what the audience thinks of that as well because what Elliot sorry of the of the of of Donald Trump's policies domestically as well because we've been talking about internationally but um I'm I'm very curious about uh how it's going to go for the Americans as well I mean I know that there's a few American Watchers so maybe they might be interested um but I think the first thing that we already discussed was the 10 to 20% uh tariffs on foreign on All Foreign goods from from every single country and I thought it was very let's say telling or or maybe not telling interesting that Trump ran on this economy is bad and we we're supposed to make the cost of eggs lower or like the eggs of your of your groceries lower and that we're now getting the 10 to 20% tariff uh which is very famously very bad for inflation uh I think as as as many of you might know is that putting tariffs on um outside or like foreign foreign countries it it sounds very nice in principle of letting other countries pay for the money or the the goods that they're sending but in the end it's the American importer that is paying that tariff making so making it so that the products that they're importing become more expensive within the United States so only that I mean the the consumer is the one that the consum yeah the consumer yeah is the one that suffers because yeah yeah so so if if a good comes I mean if I'm Texas and all of the sudden my BMW because for example if there's a 10% T tariff on a BMW and what will what will BMW do they'll just put that tariff onto the consumer okay so the car is 10% more expensive so then the consumer would have to pay 10% more that probably means that BMW will send Less sell less cars which probably means that the the the US companies will raise their prices right because there's more demand because fewer yeah it's just makes no sense if you ask me that's why every Economist hates these tariffs because they're very they're they're painful and it's and it's they're painful but sometimes crucial especially I mean this is the same debate going on the in the European Union when you're when it comes to protecting your uh key infrastructure or Key Supply chains especially when it comes to chips I mean the AI uh the chips Act was a very big thing in the United States under Joe Biden um I mean according to Americans very successful uh to most foreign countries they feel like it's a little bit unfair because it does promote a lot of American companies over the others but you can you can make the argument for protecting vital resources for State interest right so that makes sense uh it's going to be more expensive yes but at least when you know a China invades Taiwan uh you know that your supply chain is going to be secure so that is the the counter the counter strategic TS strategic tars I completely agree with you but here there's there's someone in the comments here Jeff Morris who says Trump's point is it hurts you way more than it hurts it's leverage the thing is for me it hurts everyone right because American consumers will be hurt because of the example we just gave before but what will how will the EU retaliate they will do put ter up too so for example then in that case the US will not be able to export as much or as well as it used to before it's just going to result in a trade war and but the really thing that really sucks about all of this it's not the companies losing out it's you and me man yeah no just a general citizen who who has to like you wants to pay for Consumer products or wants to anything that to live off is going to be more expensive because of this I mean frankly [ __ ] part of my French um but yeah and also uh I saw a few comments I don't mean literally literally only eggs because I know a love of eggs are made domestically in the United States but as a manner of saying like consumer products okay just to clarify yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah I thought I thought that deserved a little bit of attention but there is honestly I own a very good article by um by AP News which um even though it's very difficult in the United States to find a slightly impartial news agency I think AP News comes pretty close um there are so they they put together a list of let's say Trump policies and some of them are very funky let's say um some of them might be good are you you want you want to share something or yeah yeah I I I I wrote wrot down a long list of what I could find of of Trump's policies or at least what he said during his campaign I mean it's always you know the meme about politicians is they say whatever and whatever gets done we'll see I mean Trump does have both the house uh Senate uh Supreme yes yes this is a really good really good you mention it let's let's before you let's show that to people so for example this is the presidential race let me reset this how do I reset it here we go so uh presidential race so you me the Senate right so the Senate also went um in the Republicans favor 52 at the moment crazy the house you mentioned not yet it's still up for grabs okay yeah but jeez Elliot this basically means that if they win the house for two years I think the midterms are in two years so the midterms is when the when they go and vote again for the house they the Republicans have complete control complete all three layers of government if the house goes to the Republicans yeah and don't forget the Supreme Court because that's currently stacked 72 oh yeah the Supreme Court yeah yeah 4 to7 4 to3 right was it yeah yeah this is something your European mind can't comprehend wait it's nine I think I think it's nine Supreme Court is nine nine judges I think it's nine yeah I think it's nine so Jonas is 6 to3 uh 63 yeah yeah yeah okay but um but but Trump can the president can Place one right or point one I believe no if they die so if one well Trump is in office if someone dies if one of the Supreme Court judges dies he can replace them I see you know we should look at how old they are because then we can see juses oh yeah sorry yeah yeah we should be accur Jus yeah yeah yeah uh wasn't aren't the Democrats very old wasn't that the the meme that the Democrats are very old and that they might die under Trump oh this is this conversation here we go so Justice Thomas is Thomas Republican 75 yeah they're not that old they they probably will survive all of them IO says Trump appointed three justices last time three are 70 plus yeah yeah it's crazy it's crazy yeah and this is this is the thing like it's a really a republican um country at the moment right it's Republican time Republican mandate everywhere from from the Judiciary to to every place of of Representatives it's it's all Republican so I mean if Trump wants to get something done he can do it now you know definitely can well he has made promises so the 10% tariff on everything coming into the states that was a campaign promise the other campaign promise um he may he made loads actually but uh he made the one about getting people to pay up for NATO for example he sure yeah but I I would I would call it a little less campaign it's more like messaging towards soling you're right War within the first day so let's see yeah and and you and Gaza as well both and Gaza as well okay so that was another campaign promise uh we have generally anti-climate change uh he called it a climate hoax right so it is um getting rid of the support for electric vehicles so he says it's fine if people uh buy electric vehicles but no more subsidies no more pushing towards let's say more climate neutral surprises me right because Elon Musk is like next to him I guess so yeah by the way we haven't even talked about musk yet but very quickly I think he was a better this is me going out on a limb I think he was a better vice president than uh yeah I think was a better vice president I think he did a better job than Vance I really do okay I I really because his following apparently okay so so so so I I've read into this question lot apparently Elon Musk has quite a good relationship with Joe Rogan do you know Joe Rogan I do yeah yeah yeah the big podcaster right and um apparently I mean this is this is I don't know where I got this from but apparently um Joe Rogan didn't initially want to have Trump on Trump has asked many times to be on Joe Rogan and Elon Musk used the connection of Joe Rogan to get um to get Trump on the show which I think was massive beneficial to him because it normalized his personality and he was actually quite Charming not Charming I think as strong but he was quite good in that show uh yeah often times people use um humanized right as the as the term of oh look at this guy you know you can just sit down and have a talk with him he's such a connected connected person Trump is dead that is but um I mean I guess supporting your story would be the talk with Elon with Joe and then after that Joe Rogan endorsing Donald Trump right yeah exactly how many views that video have like 35 million something multiple millions are just all I know crazy crazy yeah um je Jeff moris says L how dare we humanize humans I'm not saying that they shouldn't um but I'm just saying that that was the the effect of what the people were saying yeah it humanized him so in in Trump's benefit yeah maybe maybe I Ed the wrong word he is right it made him um it made him just approachable I think that's a better word it was actually I actually watched and I had I had to laugh a couple times I thought he was quite funny which um yeah you thought it was funny I thought he was funny have you seen his dance at the rallies he's quite funny he is quite funny uh you're very easily Charmed lomber yeah apparently what what when he said during that live stream that um terce was his favorite word in the dictionary I I I couldn't half but laugh as well but um not not because I find it so funny BJC Von thank you for your donation he says late for the stream but greetings lber is and Elliot gretings Elliot to maybe maybe quickly run down so biggest impacts from Trump on Europe we talked about NATO we talked about Ukraine we talked about tariffs we talked about populism in Europe that could be connected um we talked about the EU taking things in their own hand is there anything else you feel that Trump has an effect on Europe for or even the chat is there anything else may chat yeah yeah what what Trump could mean for us Europe an I think we covered most important parts really um but um I guess is for us is mostly wait and see yeah uh what will happen but bro Germany is falling apart right now Schultz fired Finance Minister we will speak of did he speak did he fire him according to user optic op say yes no way oh really okay this is massive news if that's the case because I've been following that all day uh German German government Falls has the German government Fallen uh I don't know I mean no no it was they're talking while we're speaking here so if anyone in the chat knows more what's happening with the German government let us know um but yeah yeah no Elliot just to inform you uh it's not going well very other topic now with the German Coalition very badly I did hear bad things I did hear bad things let's there's some people responding in chat though European integration spoke a little bit about that how he did well that's what he says okay according to Tiger sha Schultz did fire lner yeah it collapses Jesus oh my God new you breaking news guys um very we are now a German stream probably gonna lose all our viewers now because we're going to Germany here massive news German coalition government collapses Chancellor Schultz f ERS Finance Minister lintner what was this is like minutes ago yeah this is literally minutes ago oh my God it's going to be a long night I'm going to have to create a video and you were already you were already tired from the US I'm so tired I am so tired but this is big news and it's in my in the country I live in so very quickly for the information for the should I quickly do explainer is it worth it what happened I mean listen I'm I'm I'm willing to go the entire night but I don't think you have that much time feel free you explain if you want but okay okay so obviously I don't know what the final decision was but the um so Germany has a coalition of three parties right the SPD the uh the fdp and the greens and the fdp lintner Run by lintner is being very difficult the last couple of months years even um mainly because also there is something called a do you know the schen brza Elliot is it this this like the the the fire firewolf oh oh debre no never mind doesn't like debt they hate debt so sure the they have in their constitution they can't literally they have like a debt break so they can't like make more that was it you know borrow more money and the greens in the SPD they really want to borrow money to pay for their welfare programs for the for the SPD and for the greens they want to pay for their well green programs of course and the fdp saying well in order to do that um you should basically cut cost elsewhere to use money there not borrow so that was one of the many reasons yep um and now they're designing the budget for next year the last couple weeks and uh the fdp is not willing to budge on this debt break and is being stubborn and I think that was probably part of the reasons why the government fell tonight which is crazy crazy okay and does this mean the far right gets more power not necessarily um multiple things could happen uh there could be new elections in March that's one option second option could be that they find they have a minority government until the official elections September next year option three and four no idea so I need to research into it but those are two options crazy okay anyways um when you went off on your German tangent I mean honestly sorry sorry did we lose all our viewers we lost all we we didn't actually there was quite a bit of there was quite a bit of interest in the in the chat so so it wasn't for not but we have another um another Super Chat by uh God it's a Greek name I'm pretty sure so I Nicolas I'm just going to say it looks like Nicholas to me Don um s that's Swedish Crowns right uh 50 Swedish Crowns so thank you very much about that and they say Europe needs to stand on its own we can no longer rely on other countries outside the EU to come to our Aid has the EU been too naive and we definitely covered this and I think our general conclusion is that yes perhaps we've been a bit too naive but for super naive I'd say maybe a little understandable reasons okay it it was this this na navity didn't come out of nowhere I think um would be at least my conclusion anyways yeah yeah we've been super super super naive I mean we yeah like you said we talked about it already and we need to really grow up and especially in my opinion I mentioned before in defense I think it's really important the chat also mentioned economy I also think we need to work together on uh yeah on being a bit more competitive the drogy report is the key word here yeah so okay not to make this all about us Europeans again um because it is kind of a us live stream but oh yeah we're talking about yeah we're talking about us don't forget uh I I was wondering okay in an Ideal World this would mean the European Union suddenly wakes up everyone's like okay guys we got to sit together uh we got to think about this you know the system that we have right now it's not really working that well in our favor countries are being or we being surpised left and right we are losing our economic place in the world we have to do something right I am a little bit afraid that even though we as I think more pro-european inclined people we are thinking like this but when we're looking at the general election results throughout Europe that the people who are voting more right or more for right or I guess generally anti-european parties they are not probably not feeling like this at all in a sense that we have to work more to closer together with European country like more European integration I don't think they feel like like this at all um so maybe this is a wishful thinking on our part of saying we have to work more together yes but are the people that live in Europe going to agree with that as well I don't know what you think about that I mean the European elections uh showed us that that's not really the case right um there's a lot more Nationalist and people want sovereignty in their own member states um there are some parties that are driving the Federalist idea forward but uh they're not exactly booming are they no no like yeah no they're not um so oh someone asked oh sorry the burning Swan another Super chap K name so I'll get to your question in in a second Harris asman uh donated $5 and thank you very much for your Super Chat that is very kind they ask EU continued to trade with Russia after it annexed Crimea and destabilized Georgia and the dbas yeah I agree with him EU continued to trade with Russia after oh yeah I see okay yeah so yes yeah we they build a second pipeline sorry sorup sorry ell go ahead no no no no that's fine yeah they did build it never used though but that doesn't that's only a a small side note it was yeah the Dior German expression vand dle uh really end up working out that well right it was it was a very very naive very very naive in all of Europe that basically they Annex Crimea sorry I'm gonna emphasize it again Harris is completely right and what did we do oh yeah let's build another pipeline let's continue taking R cheap Russian gas it was yeah it was very very silly um and what's what about the second part and destabilize Georgia and the donbas because of us trading with Russia I guess yeah uh partly yeah so Georgia or I think General argument was that Russia has been destabilizing in our region generally and we just kept continuing to trade with them which is uh in generally correct that it is that is a a painful true fact and actually I have to give Trump credit for that because he said it I think in the NATO Summit in 2018 or okay I might be completely wrong but he definitely said yeah he said it somewhere that stream flight line too you're you're growing dependent Germany he said it and yeah true was right but uh yeah he def he definitely wasn't the only one say saying I mean uh we don't have to go that far away from from home to say or to see which which countries were were telling Germany that this is a bad idea I mean the entire Eastern Eastern flank of Europe was screaming at Germany that this is a bad idea um so and this is what I think is a crazy thing right sorry I'm going off like you're completely right so dependent on Russia oh [ __ ] that was a mistake we're gonna have to like do do other things like get our energy elsewhere what do they do yeah oh let's close down our nuclear power plant that's the second thing did yeah oh oh no the energy prices are going up and open then they open the coal plant in order to try and get the energy prices down again and now they're in economic trouble because obviously the energy prices are too high it's like guys where was the thinking in this um which is one of the reasons I think why the Coalition is Fallen because these decisions don't make sense yeah so I mean yeah I'm okay with it as long as we end up not getting a more pro- Russia accept accepting government because then we'll have the same old thing all over again but just a bit more towards the other side um yeah I I I wanted to answer a question from user the bring Swan because they they asked um did they talk about the House of Representatives and predictions yet because we have been totally recentering the the conversation on on the European Union as as is logical obviously but um yeah we could we could I mean honestly I I know a little bit less about the House of Representatives and um the current predictions for that so maybe you know a little bit more about that yeah so that's based on um on on counties right so for example the the Senate so it's president's obvious I mean we talked about that the Senate is each state gets two senators yeah yeah yeah right so yeah there's 100 senators and that's that's like the upper house and then the lower house the House of Representatives I mean that's what you meant right so there's all of these different counties throughout the states if I'm not mistaken and they get a a representative each and they sit in the the lower house um in terms of the results I have no idea where it's going to go it looks I mean as someone in the chat mentioned it looks likely to go to the GOP which is the Republicans yeah um which wouldn't surprise me because there's a massive Red Wave um and that gives yeah like we mentioned earlier all three layers all all levels of government would go to the Republicans but before I let you go on a German rant again because I see I see people saying in chat have you seen German news or go to Schult speed no I need to see German we're gonna have to quit we're gonna have to quit soon Elliot because I really watch Coalition class there was watch it burn uh yeah actually never mind you know what I I'm going to let the co go because uh it's fun if there's any maybe maybe like last couple minutes if there's any questions I mean feel free to give us a super chat if you enjoyed the stream or become a patreon um we really really do appreciate it and maybe one last question so El questions quickly now and we can cover one more question right Elliott or what do you think yeah no absolutely I mean we recently revamped our Pat as well so we we try to give our patrons a little bit more say in where the channel is going so if you are interested in proposing any ideas or voting on video ideas that um then you definitely should check out our patreon subscription or a YouTube membership in in any case we're all very thankful for you watching anyways because otherwise we will be just talking to ourselves here um which would be a little bit weird people are calling for a Germany stream [Laughter] now you see the the interest of us politics is is dwindling by the minute yeah oh look here it is the statement will come soon for the German wait I'm not sure if they can hear this uh can can people can they hear this okay can people can you hear this or no I don't think so no I don't think they can hear it no no no no they can't they can't um unlucky but but I mean how many people speak German that as well you know the same time I be German we could uh we could definitely uh translate it translate it BC thank you again for another Super Chat are you excited for the future content uh can get spicy I mean in any case Donald Trump will provide some excellent coverage for EU Made Simple if anything were to happen with the EU so I guess we could be thankful for that enough to talk about 100% okay okay you wna you want to close it off because I feel like no no no I love I love I'm really enjoying the stream but I think I think this is probably warrant a video so I'm gonna have to work on this um and I hope that people in the chat would want to see a video on this too let me know if you do because then I will um and yeah know any last last comments Elliot before you quit I don't think so I um maybe for the people that are a bit disappointed in the Trump election try to stay a little stay a little positive if you're not an American it's go it's it's it's going to affect this one way or another but at least we're not living in the United States if you're if you're disappointed not you're not a trump fan are you Elliot sorry go ahead a little let's say I don't agree with some of his policies no no okay I mean honest like I don't think it's a big secret that I I I don't I wouldn't vote Trump let's just let's put it that way but um in general just it's it's an election result things are going to change but uh the world isn't going to end okay it's not going to be World War II to tomorrow so you know keep on breathing um and we'll we'll see we'll see tomorrow basically is the the message keep on breathing thank you that's all that was my speech vot ell 2020 thank you 2024 yeah thank you everyone it was a lot of fun thank you for joining us yeah all right uh then if that's all thank you all for watching bye-bye e e e"
