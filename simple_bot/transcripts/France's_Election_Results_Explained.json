    "transcription": "The French General Assembly election \nresults for the second round are in,   and they are super unexpected! Le \nPen’s National Rally did not win,   nor did Macron's Ensemble. Instead, the Left-Wing \ncoalition emerged victorious, securing a plurality   of seats. This surprising outcome marks a \nsignificant shift in the French political   landscape and bears all kinds of consequences.\nBear in mind that these are not presidential   elections, but parliamentary, meaning that \nMacron will stay until 2027 as planned. But before we dive into the \nfinal results and what they mean,   let's do a super quick recap of how \nFrench General Assembly elections work. In France, there are 577 constituencies, and \nin each constituency, one representative is   elected to represent their constituency \nand party in the National Assembly. This   means there are 577 seats in total, and \n289 seats are required for a majority. The election process involves a \"two-round \nsystem.\" In the first round, which took   place last week on June 30th, citizens voted for \nthe candidates and their respective parties in   their constituencies. There are two possible \noutcomes in the first round: either a single   candidate receives 50% or more of the votes, \nor none of the candidates reach this threshold. If a candidate receives 50% or more, they \nautomatically become a member of the National   Assembly, a result known as an absolute majority \nvote. In this case there will be no second round. If no candidate achieves 50%,   which is more common, a second round \nis held on July 7th, where the top   candidates face off. This example on the right \nillustrates what actually happened last night. Three candidates qualified \nfor the second round. However,   one candidate withdrew their candidacy \nbefore the runoff. Consequently,   the remaining two candidates competed, \nwith one ultimately winning the seat. Based on the results from last week, only \n76 out of 577 constituencies had a single   party winning by over 50% in the first round, \nthus determining the outcome in one round.   The remaining constituencies required \na second round to decide the winners. So, finally, what are the results? In the first round the \nfollowing seats were allocated: Le Pen’s right-wing Populist National \nRally and their allies: 38 seats  The broad left-wing alliance New Popular \nFront (also called NFP): 32 seats  Macron’s Centrists Ensemble: 2 seats\nThe Right-Wing Republicans: 1 seat Last week, it seemed as though Le Pen was \npoised to take France by storm. However,   what happened in round 2 last night? At the time of recording,\nThe republicans won and additional 44 seats  The National rally won 105 seats\nMacron’s Ensemble won a surprising 166 seats  And the New Popular Front \nwon an additional 150 seats!  Now, if we add the first and second \nround results, we get the following,   where the Left Wing Alliance emerges \nas the clear winner! And Macron in   second place. Whic h was rather unexpected!\nHowever, 289 seats are needed for a majority,   and even the New Popular Front is not \neven close to meeting that target,   as they would have needed an additional 107 seats.\nThis was unexpected, as polls before the election   showed a National Rally in first place, but they \nended up in third place. The National Rally’s   party president Jordan Bardella slammed what he \ncalled the “unnatural alliance” between Macron   and the leftists “to stop by all means National \nRally’s most important surge of its history.”  What he means is that if a National Rally (RN) \ncandidate advanced to the second round along   with two other candidates, the centrist \nand left-wing parties have strategically   withdrawn their candidates in third place. \nThis move was aimed at consolidating votes   against the far-right candidate, thereby \nincreasing the chances of defeating the RN   candidate in the final round. They did this \nin over 200 constituencies. And it worked!  But what does this mean though? \nWel there are 3 ways forward.  But before we delve into the details, \nhave you ever wondered about your own   family's past? This brings me to today's \nsponsor, MyHeritage, a true game-changer. I started by simply entering information \nabout my parents and grandparents,   and whoop – there it was! I discovered my \ngreat grandparents and many generations   further back. The process was so easy, even \nwith little family information to start with,   as MyHeritage has over 19 billion \nhistorical records to work with. \"I also stumbled upon some astonishing facts.   I always thought my family was \nentirely European, but guess what? “I found out that I have ancestors who \nhave roots in Turkey and Indonesia!\"  \"Looks like the Dutch colonial \npast in Indonesia wasn't just a   chapter in history books but a part \nof my own family story. Who knew?\" \"And check this out – I uploaded this old family \nphoto to MyHeritage. Their tools let me repair,   colourize, enhance, and even animate it.

And who will be Prime Minister?  Well there are 3 ways forward.\nThe first option is a coalition of moderates. Before the election, Macron and his allies \nfloated the idea of building a broad coalition,   including moderate lawmakers \nfrom both the left and the right,   to counter the far-right influence. \nFor example, Macron could try and   bring together Ensemble ,the Socialist Party, \nGreens, Ensemble and some of the Republicans. However, given the highly \npolarised political landscape,   forming such a coalition is difficult and \ncould lead to a paralyzed legislature. Plus,   Melenchon from the far-left France Unbowed \nhas already stated in a victory speech   that the NFP is not interested in a coalition \nwith the Macrons centrists or the Right   Wing Republicans. However, maybe the other \nparties within his coalition can be swayed. The Second option is an NFP minority government Given the New Popular Front’s large share of \nseats, Macron may be forced to appoint one of   their leaders as Prime Minister. But this \nalready presents the first problem - who?   So far the coalition has not been able to put \nforward a person who could be prime minister. The third option is a blocked parliament. With three large groups unable to agree, we could \nfind ourselves with a blocked parliament, where   any attempt at government faces a motion of no \nconfidence. In other words, a majority disagrees   and votes against it. French institutions would be \nparalyzed, and no laws could be passed. This would   be particularly difficult for civil servants \nif it results in the budget never being voted   on. It is possible that this situation could \ncontinue until the 2027 presidential elections.\n   To get out of this impasse is the appointment of a \n\"technocrat\" government, comprising ministers with   no party affiliation, similar to the government \nled by Mario Draghi in Italy from 2021 to 2022.   This approach aims to manage the country \nimpartially and maintain stability until a   more permanent solution is found. However, it is \nunlikely that a majority for this can be found. In more extreme cases, we could see constitutional \nreform or early presidential elections. But these   seem very unlikely, and we will address them \nin future videos if they become an option. French viewers and others, \nwe would love to hear from   you.
