    "transcription": "foreign the European Union announced its support for 10 new cross-border train Services across the EU this would make the EU more interconnected through rail than ever before this video will explain what this new proposal entails why the EU is choosing to develop its Railway system and what this proposal will do for EU citizens before we go into the new proposal it is worth explaining that trans European transport Network and its Vision the 10t is an EU transport Network spanning through the entire EU and connecting all major cities regions and ports via roads Railways airports seaports and waterways the goal is to create a seamless and sustainable transportation system for goods and people and boost overall economic and social development it has been in the works since the 1990s and the 10 cross-border trains announced this year will be another building block towards making this a reality the 10 proposals by the EU commission include a night train from Amsterdam to Barcelona a line connecting Lisbon to Madrid an enhancement of the existing line from Amsterdam to London a Night Train connecting Paris Milan and Venice multiple new or operated lines connecting Munich to Zurich Milan Rome Vienna and Budapest further Services connecting Austria and Hungary to Western Romania night and day trains connecting Prague Leipzig Berlin Hamburg Copenhagen and Stockholm with further day services to Gothenburg and potentially Oslo while the EU is happy to give the project its stamp of approval the commission has not yet allocated funding nor said a specific time frame for their completion instead the commission is offering to help rail overcome the following 10 key challenges that are inherent to cross-border train travel so why is the EU doing this well the EU is working towards a more sustainable and low carbon future by implementing the fit for 55 package this packages objectives for 2030 include a minimum reduction of 40 percent in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels a 32 increase in the use of renewable energy sources in the eu's energy mix in a 32.5 percent Improvement in Energy Efficiency compared to the Baseline scenario transport represents 27 of Europe's total CO2 emissions and with trades being the most efficient means of transportation it is no wonder that trains are a key component of the package the EU therefore wants a double high speed train traffic across the EU by 2030 and triple it by 2050. so how will EU citizens benefit from these changes Europeans looking to travel across the continent will soon have more options available to them thereby increasing competition and hopefully driving down prices and let's face it wouldn't you agree that train travel is much more comfortable than air travel here's what we think we love the initiative the EU is showing as it is improving the eu's infrastructure making travel more affordable and it is better for the environment we also love the bigger picture regarding the vision of the trans-european transport Network and if you would like a video solely on that let us know if you enjoy short and informative videos about the EU then please subscribe and like the video and if you want to support the channel further please consider signing up to patreon"
