    "transcription": "On August 8th, Ukraine made headlines with a bold \nand unexpected move into Russia’s Kursk oblast.   Ukrainian forces launched a rapid and decisive \ninvasion—though Putin might prefer to call it \"a   special military operation\"—swiftly capturing \nseveral border towns. Over the last 10 days,   they seized control of approximately 1000 \nsquare kilometres, including 82 settlements,   which is more than Russia has taken in the last \nyear. However, to put things into perspective,   this is only a tiny fraction of Russia. As we \nzoom out, you can see that this area is rather   small compared to Russia’s vast total territory \nof approximately 17 million square kilometres. Experts are buzzing with speculation \nthat Ukraine's want so to continue its   offensive until it reaches the river lines, \noffering more defensible positions in this   ongoing conflict. Look at this river line \nright here. Ukraine has already blown up   all 3 bridges capable of carrying \nheavy military hardware, one here,   here and here, potentially trapping Russian \nforces between Ukraine and a river. This   manoeuvre could lead to Ukraine taking \ncontrol of this entire region as well. Now, while this is not Operation \nBarbarossa, and it never will be,   it is very damaging to Russia’s reputation and war \neffort in Ukraine, and Putin is visibly annoyed. That said, Ukraine won’t be able to \nmake gains forever and will likely   be pushed back eventually. Which makes us wonder Why did Ukraine do this?\nHas it been a success?  And what can we expect from Russia and \nthe future of the war in eastern Ukraine? This video will cover all of this. This marked the first time the Ukrainian president \nclearly stated the aim of the operation. He likely   seeks to create a buffer between Russia \nand the Sumy area to limit shelling and   prevent a potential Russian advance, similar \nto what was experienced in the Kharkiv area. While this is the only official \nobjective, there has been much   speculation about what Ukraine's attack on \nthe Kursk oblast is supposed to achieve. Some believe the Ukrainian assault may \nbe strategically designed to draw highly   trained Russian troops away from the Donbas \nregion, thereby relieving pressure on eastern   Ukraine. Reports indicate that Russia has already \nstarted moving troops from Kaliningrad to Kursk,   but whether Russia is moving troops \naway from Eastern Ukraine is unclear. Additionally, this operation appears to \nbe aimed at shifting the narrative in   Ukraine's favor. On one hand, it’s a bid to \nshow the Russian people that Vladimir Putin   isn’t the all-powerful provider of security \nhe would have them believe. On the other hand,   it serves to raise Ukrainian morale and create \na positive news cycle in the EU and US media.   It demonstrates to the West that Ukraine \nremains a capable military force. This shift in focus is particularly important   as the narrative had previously been \ndominated by the Israel-Hamas conflict. Another potential motive for the attack on Kursk   is to secure leverage before any future \nnegotiations, especially before winter   sets in. Holding Russian territory \ncould strengthen Ukraine’s position,   using it as a bargaining chip to eventually \ntrade for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine,   though the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine \nsuggests that the conflict is far from over.\n   Furthermore, some say the operation challenges \nthe perception of Russia’s \"red lines,\". Putin made these threats throughout the war, \nwarning the West against supporting Ukraine,   sending military equipment to Ukraine, \nor invading Russian territory. However,   these threats have proven to be \nlargely empty, thereby paving the   way for Ukraine to increasingly utilize \nWestern weapons within Russian borders. So these are the potential motives \nof Ukraine invading Russia. However,   with the exception of our reason number 1, \nUkraine has kept very quiet about the whole   operation, leaving us with little concrete \ninformation about their true intentions. What we do know, though, is that Russia \nimmediately leapt into action. The head of   Russia's Armed Forces, claimed—following the usual \nscript—that everything was under control. This,   despite the fact that 180,000 people were in \nthe process of being evacuated to makeshift   communal tents. In fact, the Russians \npublished a video of a R ussian attack   helicopter destroying a military column in \nthe Kursk region with guided missile fire,   only to realise later that they \nhad attacked their own forces. Nonetheless, while everything is looking good \nfor Ukraine so far, can it be labelled a success? Assuming these five objectives for Ukraine, \nthe first can be seen as a partial success.   There's now a substantial buffer between \nthe Sumy and Kursk oblasts, particularly   if Ukraine secures this area, which seems like a \npossibility, with the destruction of 3 bridges. The second objective hasn't been achieved yet, as \nthere's no evidence of troops moving from Donbas   to Kursk. In a worst-case scenario, if Russia \nrapidly deploys significant troops and air   power to Kursk, they could quickly push Ukrainian \nforces back. This might result in a large portion   of Ukrainian forces being overrun without time to \norganize a proper retreat, severely undermining   Ukraine's position both on the battlefield \nand with its international supporters. In addition, if Russia makes significant gains \nin th e Donbas while Ukraine is focused on Kursk,   the entire operation could be in vain. The \nsacrifices made in Kursk might amount to   nothing if Russia strengthens its hold on the \nDonbas, where they are currently closing in on   a city called Pokrovsk. Therefore, Ukraine's \nboldness still carries considerable risk. The third objective is clearly a success. Ukraine \nis back in the headlines, with key EU and US   figures praising its resolve. Moreover, Putin's \nimage has weakened. Eventually, Ukraine’s allies   might even allow the use of long-range missiles \nagainst targets deep within Russian territory. The success of the 4th and 5th objectives \nis still uncertain. While holding Russian   land might improve Ukraine's leverage, \nthey must retain control, and Russia must   be willing to negotiate—something not \nyet evident. As for Putin's red lines,   it's a risky game. Although he hasn't \nacted on his nuclear threats, pushing   him further than ever before could change that.\nSo can this change the direction of the war? The Kursk offensive is a significant move that \ncould reshape the conflict. No matter how it ends,   Ukraine will likely keep targeting weak \npoints along its borders with Russia.   This means Russia will have to strengthen \nits defences and focus on other areas of   the war beyond just the east and south.\n \nBut as we are an EU channel, what does all   of this mean for the European Union? Well, \nthe EU is heavily invested in this war,   throwing full support behind Ukraine. A European \nCommission spokesperson has already stated that   Ukraine’s invasion of Kursk is legitimate \nand part of their right to defend themselves. However, within many EU countries, there are \npolitical parties—though in the minority—that   do not support EU aid to Ukraine. Positive news \nof Ukraine making progress could weaken these   dissenting voices and slow their growth. \nThis could also shift the European news   narrative to be more pro-Ukraine, as the success \nstories generate a lot of positive coverage. So, has the invasion into Kursk \noblast been a success? So far,   things look good for Ukraine, but it’s too \nearly to tell without knowing the official   objectives. We’ll have to wait and see how Russia \nreacts and what else Ukraine has in store.\n   Thank you so much for watching! \nAnd a special shoutout to our   discord members that helped with \nthe script, you guys are awesome!
