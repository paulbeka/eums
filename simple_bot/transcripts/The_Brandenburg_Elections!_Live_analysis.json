    "transcription": "and I think we are live hello everyone I've been already reading the comments and there's some great energy I love it I love it some are happy the greens are out some aren't anyway we'll get into all of that um and I'm here today with someone from the EU andu Instagram channel so definitely look them up you can find everything in the description um he's not German neither am I so we're two non-germans talking about German politics but we are very knowledgeable so definitely stick with us and um I'm here with yoken from the euu he studies at lien University but he's also been at the University of Manheim and tubigan so he he knows his stuff so y nice to have you here how are you man nice nice to be here very very happy a b tired because we just mentioning you and you we just had our Summit in Brussels and uh I came home from with the f was just an hour ago so yeah I'm I'm very excited to be here and very surprised with the results so let's go to it I think this is uh gonna be something interesting to analyze well good that we started late today so you can join off your uh your bus Journey but yeah Yen let's jump straight into it so everyone here on the call or on the uh on the live stream yeah what's up hgbd everyone here I am sharing uh sharing uh the results from a election in Germany this is not the German election these are like the provincial elections or what the Germans call a land lak V in in Brandenburg to be exact and here you can see the results on the screen and of course we'll go through everything but really yoka what stands out for you what was your like wow moment in this election well the first wow moment is the probably the wow moment for everyone else the spa has not only win the IFD but also has increased its vot share and not little like in a sense like if you see that the growth of the of the SP is the same as the IFD so far at least the polling we have the exit polling we have is that both parties have grown around seven seats uh which is quite impressive let's not lie to ourselves like it's like as you can say like both parties have grown seven seats which is very impressive of course the BSW has uh had a strong impact as it was expected but also that the greens which are I mean the fdp was not present in this election but the the greens were and they have been completely utterly annihilated in the L in of the of w book yeah me yeah yeah I mean loads of stuff to get into so I mean let's start with the SPD right so for for people that don't know the SPD is um you probably know Schultz he's the bundis counselor in Germany and espd is his party so uh he can be quite happy with the increase of 4.5% um and it's the center left party of of Germany I mean do you think there's um you think Schultz will be smiling right now yoka or do you think or do you think he expected more um I mean considering the results of the Saxony and um and touring in elections considering how he's at the polls I am I would not be surprised if he was jumping on the roof of of the bundas at this point um now that said I would if I was an adviser to Schultz I would advise him caution uh these are definitely good results but he barely uh tied with the afd I think they have like two seats more and it was uh like this was a mega die like the the brandenberg is the Quinter Central sdp SPD State like right this the spa has ruled brandenberg since the unification in 1990 so if they lost uh brandenberg or if they were surpassed by the afd the expansive way would have probably take schults with him I think he's he kind of like kind of seals a little bit of a light uh at the end of the tunnel but I think that the question is how deep is he in the tunnel yeah yeah I think I agree with you just for uh just to show people we're even talking about uh brandenberg is right here so it's a it's a state in Eastern Germany right in the middle here you can see you've got Berlin um so it's basically a state that covers all the sides of Berlin and yeah it's Eastern Germany and just like you said yok it's a uh spds rule there forever so it's yeah it's and considering that the afd was leading all the polls before the election this is quite impressive that they did win it with 30.7% so uh good day for Schultz yeah yeah go ahead no no I was going to say that and also if you see the polls it has been a very recent uptrend like um kind of like the like FD has been on top of the B for for a long for a lot of weeks and recently they just made a huge Spike so uh this is I think a very recent Trend like the fact that the espd was able to win it it's a big surprise because I think the afd were hoping for a victory yeah oh before we even go to the afd or the BSW let's talk about the greens I I love saying to say they got deleted right I mean they had over 10% only five years ago like a proper force and they now have below 5% 4.2% and before I ask you yoka just quickly to explain it to the audience if you don't get above 5% in a state election like they did here it means you don't get any seats in the state Parliament so Germany has a German Federal Parliament and a state Parliament too and the greens are now out of the state Parliament um over the next five years which is which is insane right I mean what do you think what do you think led to this well um I think a variety of things uh so for I think most of the audience knows because your audience is formed by extremely intelligent and cultured people that Germany has a very big East West divide but that East West divided also exists within the political parties themselves and uh the greens are very West party like the leadership formed by West Germans the the policy focus is mostly confirmed by West Germans so a lot of the issues were not that did not include the the greens from East Germany so um and also this is a like this is something that has been going on with the ample Coalition like the the traffic light Coalition of Germany that that that's a coalition of the ESP the greens and the Liberals and that is that because the polls is are so bad for them they they've been trying each party has been trying to appeal to its space as much as possible to avoid an Annihilation and because most of the base of the greens is um uh in West Germany the federal direction of of of of of the greens which is composed by uh Minister foreign minister analina Bok and vice Chancellor H habek has been giving priority to the West section of the greens but that means that the the East section of the greens has been completely abandoned and the the the priorities of their VOE has been very much ignored I also believe that uh a lot of it has to do with the fact that uh they really really really wanted to avoid an ific trade um the you can see that the the growth of the SPD is around 5% and the the decrease of the GRE is around 7% round rounding a little bit um it's it's very likely that that a lot of it has gone to the sdp SPD sorry um probably something to the BSW but most of it has gone definitely to the SPD so the the greens and but again there there is trends for for example the issue of the war in Ukraine most East Germans don't tend to be that friendly to the idea of over militarization which is something that uh both anal Bok and Robert hav have been pushing greatly uh the environmental reforms they have done they probably have not been they have they kind of like the households of of penberg quite a lot so there is a backlash definitely and once it was clear that the greens were flirting with the idea of maybe getting into Parliament or not but the afd could get the first a lot of green voters said just forget about it just vote I mean I think there's like one key thing that happened right and that was that um that basically the the SD the the leader of the SPD not the leader of the SPD but the leader of the SPD in Brandenburg right his name is uh the D Marka right he's the spiten is what you call in Germany He also mentioned very clearly like if the afd wins against me um then I will resign oh yeah exactly yeah and I and I think I think a lot of a lot of people living in brenberg it hit quite hard because apparently the leader of the SPD so again this de Marka he is very well liked 65% I think of the people in bber said he did a good job so when he said that they were like oh no then he will go and I think a lot of people flocked from other parties they normally vote for for example the greens for example I mean this is my opinion the left maybe the CDU left maybe not so much but they went to the SPD right to to to vote for him because they liked him exactly yeah yeah yeah I think that he has done a very good job very good campaign in that sense um which and this is what I was saying before about caution for har Schultz a a big reason why he's done a good cign it's because he has moved away from the figure of Schultz yeah like void has avoided presenting like himself as just a delegate from Schon instead as a proper independent brandenberg candidate um which uh it has its uh kind of like like of course its advantages for him because it AO it makes sure that he can avoid all the noise from Berlin but at the same time uh I'm I'm doubting how much of it could will trans into advantages for Schultz yeah exactly and this I think this is key um the the votes didn't go to SBD because of Schultz it went to the SBD for two reasons if you ask me this guy on the screen so di Marvo who's well liked and the second reason being oh no we don't want the afd in government I I was watching TV earlier I live in Germany and apparently there was a uh a poll that showed that 75% of people that voted for SPD uh didn't vote for SPD because they like the SPD but because they didn't like the AF so yeah so that's not a good sign for the SBD no yeah especially because currently the feder in federal at Federal level the party that can only win the IFD is a CDU so if if uh the conditions apply from brur to to German level I think Mr Schulz should actually be rather worried yeah I mean I mean it's interesting I'm was reading the comments um Villa for example says I'm glad SPD won but I wish SCH still quit um and I know I'm getting off topic a little bit here but yoka do you think do you think he will be replaced for the German elections I mean I'm getting very off topic but why not no of course man this this has definitely a federal impact like this is undeniable um Germans leaders don't tend to work like that the like the German politicians are not used to this kind of like uh turns rapid turns of events as they were like the French legislative elections or before that the Spanish general elections like they didn't do like things in order so um and I think Schultz wants to be the candidate uh but I seriously but I think that as they get closes it's not going to be possible the at the same time there is a problem for Schultz and that is that there is an obvious replacement which is Boris pistorio who is he who is he quickly for the group here the Minister of Defense the very very popular minister of defense I think they only popular minister of the current Schultz government which is bad um so some people if theb have on especially also in the media has been F been thinking of the idea of replacing Schultz with pistol um yeah and the thing is like the but honest but at this point I seriously doubt this is gonna have a serious impact uh like uh I think the afd has going going down a little bit from that that kind of like growing Trend it had during Christmas and during winter but it it it will clearly reach at least the the third or even second place and at this point I think the CDU has the clear Advantage when it comes to a federal level so pistus could change something maybe the the CDU has not agreed on a candidate yes they have they have they have they have they have oh I missed that then yeah yeah this was this week the CDU has agreed on mats FR mats okay this is GNA be another we'll get there in a minute let's finish the SPD topic yeah but but but actually like like uh because V probably sees this Victory as his victory not Sha's victory that might create a force within the SP that might push Schultz aside I mean there's even um I quite like this analogy uh I don't know again I watch a lot of German talk shows and some of them are some of them mention like uh Schultz is becoming the German Biden where he doesn't know yet that he's unpopular um and that he'll eventually be replaced like three months before the election let's see if that actually happens but uh but interesting anyway if we make to make comparisons I think that more than the uh Joe Biden I think Schultz is the German Jimmy Carter oh yeah interesting yes um he's someone that went into the I mean because uh like he he he like the conditions which Biden became presidents were very special I think yeah he was like the anti-trump but Schulz came to power more like as the kind of like the order candidate and the the stability the order as the Germans say um and he was kind of like this honest and uh respectable and uh um decent person uh in comparison with people from the CDU like Alin lashed who had done a very bad job handling the flood in 2021 um but the thing is uh much like Jimmy Carter he was not Schultz has not been up to the task that he is G given um like the Coalition of of the ample quality like the the the traffic light Coalition of of of of of of ESP greens and liberals was the perfect Coalition until Russia invaded Ukraine in that moment everything I don't know if we can swear in this podcast maybe not but you know you can guests guests can yeah everything went to yeah just just as simple as that the the the parties were not ready to adapt quick enough because I mean yes they were quick to adapt to the Ukraine situation but not everything else because the Schultz announced the Sean vendor which is like a change of times he announced this I think was a trillion budget for the military which that sounds great but suddenly people thinking wait then why are you not investing in other issues that we are also worried about yeah defense for Ukraine is important but we also worried about infrastructure we're also worried about U other like housing and and other issues like the flaws in in uh that occurred in 2021 were occurred in part for lack of investment for for anti floting and and that's when the fdp comes to play no no we cannot invest but then the and of course the energy situation forc the greens to get into kind of like this crazy schizophrenia of of are we in favor of of Co are we against nuclear power but we in favor of coal and you know all of these confusing and like and and and I think the problem is that and this is something that also happened to Jimmy Carter in a sense is like in Jimmy Carter's Administration there were a lot of people that were very charismatic except Jimmy Carter and I think Schultz had a very array of very charismatic people or very people capable of leading or with very strong personalities and abok OB Hab Christian lner pistorio except him right right so and I think that if things go this way I think that if Schultz is the uh the German Jimmy Carter Mez could become potentially the uh German Reagan and he has a lot of the policies of that kind of like neoliberal and pro military kind of vibe um again this is just more like predictions and also I study history as well so I to make analogies but um yeah this is how I I see this situation and and I honestly I don't I think that I I don't think think Schultz is gonna I mean he could continue being candidate and maybe this but he's not going to be Chancellor again I'm sorry yeah um y I'm going to go to the comments because there's a couple of interesting questions here and there and by the way if you do have a question it's easier if you tag EU Made Simple so I can quickly see them when I look at the comments um but here is an interesting one why is the afd doing well in Germany but nobody wants to Ally with them in the EU Parliament um I mean maybe I I'll answer the first half Yoko maybe and you can answer the second half please good yeah yeah so maybe maybe because it is an EU channel so I'm going to jump into the EU Parliament um they have allied with someone in the European Parliament they're basically leading the sovereignist the afd so there's literally a group in the European Parliament that's that's theirs but the reason why no bigger groups want to want to work with them in the European Parliament is basically because they are a bit too extreme even for the Extremes in in France and in Italy now when it comes to Germany and here y I'll ask you is does anyone want to work with the afd is is there a chance that they can form a coalition for Brandenburg with any of these parties here no and I don't think they want um thing is um remember what we said about um the East being depending on the like the the the the the the east west division within the political parties which also uh I think that the afd has happened the opposite of the greens like they are being controlled mainly by the East section of the party and uh the problem is that like for example for example uh the afd if you see the election results in of the afd during the European elections they were really good in East Germany yeah not so well in West Germany yeah the if you only count West German states the afd actually had pretty bad results like if you compare to all farri parties in Europe like the oralia or ET they had a pretty mediocre results if you know like in some case States were're not even passing the 10% um H so the the problem is like the afd it's kind of like the anti-establishment party uh and they really like that that way like they and they also like to bring in a lot of people that are extremely radical which they could not even work in a government also the like it's not like the maybe the Frat Italia where they maybe bring people from previous beroni governments or you know they have people with some sort of experience in government and they might like to participate they are actually just the the the the the more radical sections of of German conservative uh movement so I don't think they even they themselves want that first of all with this numbers they don't they're not going to get it and also the CDU does not want to associate themselves with the because and that's also connecting what you said about the EU like some of the people that the IFD has aligned with in the European Parliament I could say that even they're even worse than them like they're like you know they the the far right they're almost a cartoony version of the far R you know like they they they're extremely radical um and I don't the things like I don't think they even themselves want to rule for example like the the fact that in in in brandenbur they keep Chang ing leaders like the the the the spitzing candidat of of 20 I don't remember his name but I the spitzing candidat of of of 2024 was a different one from the one from 2019 that was different from the one from 2014 etc etc so right for the the H Kristoff B was the one this this time around yeah this time around exactly so I I I think that uh but I think that they no one wants to rule with them because I don't think even themselves they want to rule I think they I mean I think they would like to rule Orban style kind of like with an absolute majority but I don't think they will get that hope at least hopefully um yeah yeah so again it's just that they offer very little to work with I mean they they um especially with uh the events with in poom you know the poom conference that that occurred I think back in January was it yeah the one with the remigration right so exactly yeah exactly so yeah no no I was just like the thing is like the CDU benefit the only party that could actually rule with them is is either the CDU or the or the BSW and and that's the thing right which I always find I mean maybe the comments will kill me for saying this but if you look at migration alone the cdu's policies at the moment which are which Fred Merz by the way everyone fredr Merz is the new CDU spitzen candidat for the elections next year so the the the whole German elections anyway former CEO of Black Rock yeah former exactly but he's um he's very very very strict on migration and it's it's it's maybe it doesn't go as far as the afd because the afd want to quit the the Euro Zone you know when to leave the Euro um don't there's loads of other things that the the the afd also wants to do but the CDU is also very strict to migration so there's lots of policies where they actually quite align well more with with the afd than for example I don't know the greens if you know what I mean not on everything but on a lot of stuff yeah or or am I wrong am I wrong no no no I I think you're right the problem is that this is not a CH like political parties is not a field where you can cherry pick things you know you can you can just grab things you like from one party and then from another this is a full package and the and the afd has some truly uh anti-democratic proposals um which are a lot of a lot of anti-democratic connections which they come together with the immigration right so um the problem with the the city the CDU could try to make some deals in some occasions but for for that the afd would try need to be constructive and I don't think they want that yeah I I think they they have a lot it's very easy being in opposition and complaining right and there and I mean the afd has perfected it even sometimes when I watch them in the in the parliament I'm like hell yeah they make a point but you know it's very easy easy to complain and then you know if they do get into government at some point and Lead um the question then becomes can they perform and that's why another question for you is is this brma so the brma meaning we will not work with the afd so all of the parties have pretty much signed on to this saying they will that sounds much better than Cordon San yeah exactly the the BR ma exactly do you think it's correct do you think it's right or will it just strengthen the afd going forward um I think this is a a very good question I I think it's a very good question because it has like throughout Europe you have have you can find cases of both you find cases of full collaboration and you have cases of of anti anti any sort of collaboration I think one of the first cases was in in Flanders and with the flams blog now named flams blang um of course the the case of Leen but uh I I you also have cases of the other way around for example a lot of people say that the growth of the PV in the Netherlands during the last election was because the the vbd leader the leader of the leader of the Liberals Miss Yus said before the election that she was ready to form a government with with the pbv and that said oh then in that case like I will vote for the PVB then because uh so so yeah okay so so you're basically saying if if let me just get this into German politics so if you're saying if the CDU would for example say we are open to to making a Coalition with the afd then what could happen is that lots of people will be like ah it normalizes the afd and now I can vote for them because they have a chance of making it to government correct is that that's the yeah yeah yeah because if if the CDU if mer says oh actually that if the nice people then you might have people that were voting for this for the CDU because they didn't like the because they oh and in that case I want the CDU to be very conservative or like to enact very conservative policy so I will vote for the afd and at the same time you have people that might left the CDU because they they don't want to work with afd so again it is not a a clear mathematical result you know if you know what I mean uh it is a very kind of like broad because also you have example for example in Austria the the every time the I think the FP has entered into coalitions has not come out the strongest um right so now you're talking about Austrian politics right the FB is the far right uh a afd version of the afd in Austria right yeah the much more successful one which actually has been in government in Austria several times but yeah what I'm trying to say is like it's nothing it's not a mathematical equation you cannot say far right plus government equals growth or far right minus Cordon sanitary equals uh decrees there is a lot of circumstances around it and also every party is different in the case of the in the case of the afd they they don't have any constructive proposals uh for government they have very they've never ruled even in Coalition with in any state they have very any any experience in in major in my kind of like City rule but then that's my point right you like here for example let me let me also reply to one of the comments obscured right here says The Cordon San brm holds a significant benefit which lies in extremist to be set outside of influence for the current period it does however lead to electoral empowerment of them yeah because this is my point like if you let them I'm not saying you should I'm just being devil's advocate here imagine you let the afd rule together with someone else people might notice oh nothing is really improving to how you know nothing's improving I still don't like it and they might you know grow tired of the afd for example and write right now what's happening so that's one alternative the other alternative what's happening is that the afd is not power but they are literally influencing everything like our whole focus on migration is mainly because of the afd and I'm not sure what the better option is I I really don't um and um yeah any any thoughts to that I would say there is not necessarily a better option again there is a lot of circumstances I think that um the the only way of tackling the far right is actually uh dealing with the issues that de that lead to their growth um yeah not not and but also in the in the case in the case of is Germany uh is also the the situation of um of of two of of of especially a lot of things uh and uh one of them for example we've been talking before this the participation has greatly increased like we've seen an increase of like 11 points when it come in the participation in this election a lot of these people are afd voters like a lot of the afd voters are not people who voted the alinka or who voted SPD or voted CD a lot of people are people that did not vote before yeah um and I think that this is this is a problem of the of the East German political parties because they fail to have to engage sectors of the population or address issues of of the population um how however I would say that if if if if time passes and the FD is just seen as kind of like this useless thing um uh that just wants to make noise because I think that for example uh something that has been very smart and I know a lot of people are going to criticize me and a lot of a lot of my friends if they watch me they're going to criticize me yeah I think something that might be H example of something dealing with in a in a sort of smart way was how what Maron did with the nomination of barer so okay so so let me just quickly explain so this is macron um choosing a prime minister in France his name is Mel barer right exactly used to work in the EU and everything okay okay okay continue yeah what about is a right-wing prime minister who is for going to form a right-wing government uh as opposed to a leftwing one which is and because the left was kind of like the one who got the most votes in the election uh but B has nominated a right-wing prime minister and why is this interest interesting because now you put the far right into a situation in which they need to decide if they want to collaborate or if they want to just be uh empty noise MH so instead of of think should I collaborate with them should not I should I not collaborate with them I think that party should try to think of of calling their Bluff in the sense of okay I'm gonna put forward a proposal that I think some of your voters might like because most afd voters are not crazy Nazis most of people are normal people with normal wishes and normal ones from from like right so I think a smart idea with I'm G to make a proposal that I know your voters would probably accept and I'm going to I'm going to tempt you to say are you are going to accept it therefore you are you are telling me that you're ready to make to participate in politics or you're going to reject it which means that you just want to you know make noise for the sake of making noise recently for example in the US uh I know I'm jumping from country to Country to Country yeah yeah make it make it brief because I really want to get to questions in the in the chat so yeah the US like in the US for example the Democrats and the Republicans agreed on a migration reform for the border security and that bill got killed by Trump supporting Republicans and that was just for the sake of the reason that Trump wanted to run on migration and and he didn't want the issue to be solved and that I think has backfired in a way because there's a lot of Republicans who are angry at him because it because chaos for the sake of chaos is not the wish of the voters and I think that if you play with the far right if you don't allow the far right to dictate narrative but you are the one who dictates The Narrative to the far right that's when you can try to uh see them fail at least that this is a bit my perspective I know it's kind of yeah let's yeah it's a very fair point and I think the afd is definitely benefiting of not being in government and being able to just complain about real issues that people have but let's go to the chat there's loads of questions um everyone thank you for tagging eate simple always tag it you made simple and if you I can't cover all the questions so if you want your question to be definitely asked then a Super Chat will be lovely thank you so much but let's go to a very valid question here uh oh let me scroll up where was it it was there was someone asking about the BSW I here Charlie star thank you for your question could you please talk about the BSW what do they stand for who do they take votes from and what could be their impact on a coalition so let's do that maybe offer to you Yoko the BSW who won 133% of the total vote uh so the the BSW which is basically anation I'm not sure s yeah go ahead yeah s was the former leader of the Linka and the former wife of a former leader of the Linka oscara Fontaine and she represents the more um you could say socially conservative in a left fashion sector of the Linka I know okay this is okay so this is a bit confusing so uh so like East German Society is not that socially Progressive they don't tend they they usually are more conservative things like migration or things like uh in the environment or they are more Pro um uh Pro Russian or at least not in favor of NATO very anti- NATO and they are not in favor of kind of like this more modernist abstract left uh view that the Linka sometimes has again in the west so uh this is again this is meant to represent the more like all style leftwing uh movement of of Germany it's a very East German movement so they economically they are very leftwing you know they want to increase taxes they want to increase social spending they want you know all all of the very left things but to sum up when it comes economically they're like the Linko right but then yeah and then the next category anti anti- migration anti um anti- environment and environmental that's where they're like the afd right so they social I mean sorry economic like Linka then migration and environment like the AF D so okay okay so they're like a mix of everything I think they're a product of of East German Society I think that they're like they they're very East German movement it it it it makes sense why they will grow so much in these regions yeah yeah and and but okay I think this is also interesting right because they are on 133% and they were formed I think in January this year so a very very new party um and there where did they get their votes from I mean my big assumption will be the Linker because they lost 8% um and where else like who who is flocking to BSW of again a lot of people who did not vote before with an increase of 11 11 points of participation there is a lot of people who were not did not vote before went to the Sarah move movement and to a very little extent I mean I mean if you can actually check there if uh uh yeah sorry sorry quickly interrupt you I'm just looking at this is quite a cool chart so from the left 42 the biggest loss for the left is indeed BSW yeah and from the greens this would be interesting not the BSW that's SPD yeah makes sense so anything else oh here here this is this is a good chart there we go this is what we needed so yeah the left indeed and the SPD and then your right n v 177,000 new votes yeah and also 11,000 votes from the which is interesting oh yeah we'll get into them we'll get into them later let's first finish the BSW yeah yeah so um they they they they they are very this very East German movement of like mixing left-wing economics and anti-at stuff with more like socially uh like anti-immigration kind of like more like more way of environmental these movements um but unlike the afd they are way more constructive in government they for example they've also ruled out any Coalition with the afd um I would Al I would however be careful in in the other two states that we had elections especially in saxity because if they can form a majority with the afd I don't do they form a majority in this now I in this state like would a coalition of the afd and and BSW work on let's quickly check so afd and BSW let's check so the afd has how many seats 30 seats plus BSW yeah that would no it wouldn't 44 just on the on the cut so very quickly to explain to this is the next topic we'll get into but um to get the to get a Coalition in Brandenburg you need 45 seats why because there's 88 seats in total so you need to get 45 which is over half to rule in Brandenburg and just like you mentioned yoka um afd and BSW would be 44 seats so they couldn't rule actually they they miss they're missing one seat yeah but I think in touring and they could in uh one of the states they recently voted yeah but even even the BSW has said they will not rule together with afd no because they want to actually I think the BSW actually wants to influence government I think they W to get things done um and so I I think that they they will be even with the CDU which I find hilarious if I if you ask me um but like they want to be more constructive so I think that they again the problem is like if they form a coalition with the afd any other deal they could do in the arrest of Germany is over with the other parties so I think they they rather you know just make a deal with the CDU or with the SPD and just uh keep doing alliances because they they really want to influence government I don't think the is really interesting in in influence directly government yeah it be it is interesting so that's that's BSW so let me see if there's any last questions on the BSW um okay maybe last question from Tri Tri tricerat tops God what a name uh thanks for your question why isn't BSW competing in some Western States well it's a good question um like you mentioned already they're strong in the East maybe quickly what do you think are the main reasons they're not strong in the west is it just because of their Roots you know coming from the left and all that not only that I mean this is basically the DDR party the the the the the the the party of the German Democratic Republic in the sense like it is the party of the people did you go that far I mean not not to the extent that they want to to reinstate aasi but they definitely have some of the ideas of of the of the more maybe more moderate sections of of of that and but like they they mix the values in the same way that DDR did um and I think that the problem is like uh and and the problem is like communism in or very far-left political movements have not been popular in West Germany since 1945 and that's a fact uh the all the all the left Wingers who did not want to vote sdpd have always gone to the greens right so the so they have always RI on a base of so in in the East they always rely on the RAS of the Linka and the thing is like they they would definitely need to change their their platform a lot to kind of like establish a base in West Germany and and and again we're talking again about H the division within the political parties and and I don't think they want to do that I think they much rather have be strong in the East and have an influence in Germany or in German local politics rather than get into this kind of like schizophrenia of kind of like support one thing in the west I support another in the East and kind of like contradicting each other right right right okay okay so so let's let's go to the next topic right because this is where it gets really interesting so in order to rule in in um in Brandenburg you need that was very American you need 45 seats out of 88 so that here I mean the site already does the job for us they see two possibilities so the SPD BSW CDU right um the SPD BSW which gets him over 44 or even the SPD CDU and greens which is not possible because the greens are out andd CDU is not possible either because it's only 44 not 45 I mean looking to your crystal bow Yoko what is going to happen I think it's going to be most likely uh is BSW CDU even I mean I why do you think they take the CDU also why not just go spd BSW what what's the added benefit to include the CDU into a coalition making it even more complicated I mean I if I was I mean long term it would be better not to have the CDU in because you need uh right-wing party in opposition that it's not crazy um but I think the void wants to not be dependent on one party and kind of like have two kind of like to balance out each other um but uh what it's what is undeniable is that the BSW is going to be part of that okay okay so so you so you think SBD BSW and CDU interesting let me yeah go ahead also because they the CDU has ruled with the espd for the past five years so they there is a certain trust with each other so uh I think that they rather like keep that keep that going but again I'm not I'm not I'm not nost I just speculate I mean these are still not the final results so there could be a case where the CDU or the SPD still gets one more seat by any luck or any luck or unluck depends what how you feel about it and then you could potentially this would be the most likely option then right the SPD and CDU yes yeah if they can manage one SE more yes yes yeah yeah I would things the same geez I still can't believe the greens are out um anyway um there is another party that I quickly want to cover I know we're talking about coalitions already so going to move back to something called the BVB and FW so I think they're called in English uh what was it again um free voters the free voters yes who who are they the free voters it's um it's an interesting party it's it's kind of like a the more the rural version of the fdp to an extent it's a Centrist uh party Focus extremely on decentralization uh tends to vote more with closer to the CDU and they are currently of the Bavarian government um and they they tend to be very Regional based I think one of the problems is that uh the fdp has never had a strong presence in East Germany right and the and what another reason for that is because they they're too associated with West Germany and there is a strong sense of regionalism in East Germany um the the F Val the free voters have always been a very regionalist party in the sense like they want to decentralize the country like they want to guarantee the rights of the lender and the states okay and they also lost quite hard right yes and yeah I mean like look at that they lost most to the BSW interestingly but they still gained 2,000 votes for the links the Linka that's interesting that's interesting too from the left to that's that's very interesting yeah yeah yeah I think that it makes sense because they tend to be also more socially conservative but more Progressive in other aspects MH yeah I guess I guess yeah interesting interesting so and then maybe maybe one like special shout out what happened to the fdp so very quickly just to explain their the ruling Coalition in Germany um is the SPD of course you should know that by now the greens who lost massively and someone else that is not even in this chart called the fdp and I know from another website I've opened they got less than 1% of the vote what what happened there what happened there yeah the fdp is the party of kind of like the more business oriented kind of like Basi if you want to call it that um and simply put it after so many years of Communism there is not that in East Germany um or if there is it mostly lives in West Germany yeah yeah or in Berlin a lot of it as we we have not we have not mentioned that the brandenberg state completely surrounds Berlin and uh they a lot of the population centers is basically a lot of people that cannot afford anymore live in Berlin so they kind of like live in of the outskirts and it's in in in Brandenburg poam for example poam is the one of the main cities in brenberg isn't that the cap the capital of uh of of of Brandenburg yeah yeah yeah interesting interesting so we do have another question um which is here from Samuel thank you for your question again we're jumping a bit over the place but it's a good question whyd prefer to do a coalition with the CDU who's rightwing instead of the BSW who he claims is left conservative um I think it's it's um a question of of like more like establishment I think that the CDU and the SP although from different sections they tend to be very um kind of like aware of the rules so to speak and they know each other politics is not only about ideology it's also about trust and uh also the CDU it's not always a very I mean it's now maybe with Ms has been more like right-wing but it has been a more like Centrist party in yeah I mean yeah center right is what usually you know historically is yeah yes so but the thing is like they know each other and they they they work together and also uh there is a there's a lot of predent in the past they've they've collaborated together to AVID for example the entrance of of the alinka in the government and all of that but you know I don't think yeah go ahead I was just gonna say there's also the big topic of Ukraine no because BSW is very very clear that whoever they work with they would like them to stop supporting Ukraine like they stand for they do not want any more military aid to Ukraine yes and that's a big deal it's a massive deal I think it's hilarious too because these are elections and the way that your Germany works you have a federal government and a regional government the regional government is responsible for education for local infrastructure I think and things like that and healthare and then the federal government is is um is responsible for foreign policy defense things like that and taxes of course and um and I think it's funny that like B bundes she literally ran on stopping Aid to Ukraine but she can't stop any of that from Brandenburg right I mean I mean I still can't believe it was so successful running on that story yeah yeah I mean again East Germany has a strange history with Russia um and not a a a strong anti Nat history so again it makes sense that people sorry you mean they're anti- NATO you mean right anti- America yeah anti- America anti NATO um Pro Russia to an extent um they uh also Al they they tend to be very anti- Poland which is has an even longer history of East German politics so uh that kind of like uh but but at the same time I think the reason is that people vote on issues that they they like to talk about or they listen about uh in the media in the in the TV uh on on on Twitter like on where people chat about it and I and the thing is like recently most of the talk has been around foreign policy right yeah so it makes I I get why why and but also it is one of the reasons maybe where there is an participation increase yeah I mean coming back to go ahead go ahead no I was saying like if you have running maybe only kind of like very local very basic a lot of people maybe have not turned out to vote yeah I just think I mean going back to your comment you know that East Germany is so different than Poland and and things like that for me it's it's strange because if you look at the btic states if you look at Poland if you look atch Republic I mean all of these more Central Eastern countries they all are very wary of Russia they're all very supportive of NATO um and they're all increasing their budget and think that their military budget and think that supporting Ukraine is literally like existential or you know very important that's that's what I wanted to say and then you have East Germany who is just like the not not all of them again but a lot of the people there are the opposite who are just not as concerned about Russian aggression in Ukraine or maybe concerned but don't want to do any Military Support against it I think there's yeah I I think it has to do with um something that we forget is that the his the political history of Germany does not start in 1945 and that uh there is a long long long history of Germans of the East um having a very negative view of of polls and of of Cs or isans yeah I mean I I we have um we published an a post in the unu recently uh in which uh we show that the growth of the afd in is Germany is definitely not something new because if you see the elections of Germany of 1924 the uh the results of of the of of of German of East German provinces at the time was very similar to the one today just instead of the afd was another party called the German national People's Party basically um uh but again like the the legacy of uh in East Germany is not necessarily the legacy of the DDR as much as it's the legacy of Prussia like the the the East Germans have um in East Germany there's a a long history of of order and command kind of like a very uh hierarchical authoritarian view of rule that is why there is a lot of there were until recently there was a big participation Gap because um again this is not to say that is German I by default like that but there is a there is a kind of like a trend of political tradition that that's why the afd grow so much that's why they the Linka grow and that's grew not anymore but that's why the the BSW grow so much like right and I I encourage people to to kind of like see the the election Maps before the the Nazis took over and you see that the trends we're seeing right now are not that new that they they've going on for a long time and the uh the East Germans were in many ways kind of like the stars or like the the second fiddles of the Soviet Block in a way um within the West within the the Soviet uh kind of like the the war PCT I was the word within the war pack it was the Soviets but after the Soviets the East Germans saw themselves as kind of like the the second most important one the and under the those polls and Czechs and Romanians and Lans and all of that um so I think that some people uh really feel like uh with the unification and with the alliance to Nato they've gone from the second fiddle so to speak to kind of like the last the top bottom um so bar is kind of like like that resentment um and also because the the the again like the Germans don't feel like that much the feel like the feel of Russia and that there is certainly like a a respect maybe because of the legacy of the of the Red Army but they they uh they see themselves as they as they should kind of like rule the region like they should be like the the ones who all of this kind of like um kind of like a say say like negotiation and Coalition and consensus building that that's why it's something some of the more radical people in this Germany again those who are voting the afd not do not support yeah yeah sorry I'm smiling sometimes because I'm reading some of the comments which are which are funny comment section is uh really read it I'm not reading the comment section I think you should definitely read it after after our live stream there's some very interesting interesting comments I'm I'm also enjoying it while listening to you I hope that I hope they're not insulting me no no no no they're not they're not here you actually got a compliment I like the guest a lot someone said so I I like this person too I don't know who you are but I like it too anyway um all right let's let's let's go to the final question of the night right so because I have by the way for the whole audience here there's a video coming out on this very soon I'm working on that um but the final question of the night so we had brandenberg we had Saxony we had turingan and then we have the big one coming which is the national election next year in Germany if you had to look at Crystal Ball now what do you think the Coalition will look like with what bundes consla in a year time H interesting uh I feel because um I think Ms it's going to try uh to Ms is going to present himself as the candidate who can solve Germany in a way kind of like there is a general pessimism right now um among uh Germans I think that uh like that that kind of like glorious year so to speak of of of 2013 20 2014 you know when when Germany was like at the top of the economic growth and everyone was relying on what everyone was listening to what Merkel was saying and soever I think m is gonna present himself as this the one who can solve it but with a very different attitude so you think okay so so to to pin you down you think Meritt will be the bundus counselor absolutely if he's the candidate if if he's the candidate of the CDU and and nothing EX extremely radical changes if the if these Trends continue I mean and the only thing that could change that I think is if pistus is a candidate of the espd but so far I don't see that happening if if if that changes if that changes then uh then maybe they could we could see a bit more competitive election but if if Schultz is still the candidate then I have no doubt mat is gonna be the mat is gonna be the candidate and uh who's GNA he rule with uh I would say either with the SPD or with the greens okay so very quickly for the audience so this is really interesting so CDU is currently winning the national uh polls so at the moment they're in 33% almost which is quite High actually the afd is second and the sp sp is third so you're thinking the CDU and the SPD I mean the SPD would have to have to take some votes away from other parties in order to make that a possibility but then you could have another grand Coalition yes or the greens you mentioned yeah I mean if the numbers I mean uh I think um during the last months the greens have been going down in the polls because until uh not so I think some months ago they they were like almost tie tie with the with the SPD um if if it's not enough with if the SPD and the greens go so down both that it's not enough with both of them and the CDU is not taking those votes you could see like a three Coalition between the SP uh the CDU and the greens but I'm not sure if I I'm not sure if I see the greens I mean I mean they I don't the CDU and especially the CSU I mean you probably know Mar Coda he is of course the king of yes yeah king of king of Bavaria right so I live King of memes yeah that too that too but he's also the king of Bavaria and I live in Bavaria so he's like very present here very present in his uh social media and everything anyway he's from the CSU and he hates the greens I'm not going to lie he even said I will only rule with the greens Over My Dead Body so there is not a lot of love for the greens in Bavaria and I think zurer is already doing a lot to support merits so I I think he will try everything not to go with greens but rather with someone else I mean the see I don't you think that CDU and the fdp if they get over 5% and the SPD would be more likely um there is an issue which is foreign policy um me has already established that he wants to send fighter jets to Ukraine and M it's uh taking a lot of the hawkish kind of like pro-military pro- anti-russia Pro Ukraine attitude of the greens so um if the issue of foreign policy is very important I I don't know how willing is going to be the CDU of collaborating with the espd if they keep putting so many blocks to the kind of like to the way as as they've been doing for the last years right so I think it will all depend on domest because I think for domestic policy yes for domes policy I think even Ms would prefer the SPD but if it's uh for foreign policy I'm not that sure and also m is a free market guy I think he he he's not he's not a I don't think he's going to be um kind of like a austerity kind of like a budget Balan budget guy I think Germans really want investment and really want to kind of like put money on their land put money on the infrastructure yeah yeah um and that's why I made the comparison that Ms could be uh Germans Germany's Reagan I say this as a neutral term I do not necessarily I mean I I I'm not saying I do or I do not but I I'm saying that the idea of a pro-military pro kind of like uh free market but also because Reagan increased the debt a lot the de a lot and it's possible that under the mats that the German debt could increase but at the same time I I don't think that I think Germans are starting to feel a bit tired of this kind of like almost calvinistic religiously yeah like dude you cannot increase the debt until this percentage but because the infrastructure like yeah yeah I mean just just very quickly for our audience um it's the fdp that is very very much in favor of no more debt so that's why I think you're arguing right that uh having the CDU go with the fdp would also be difficult again because the fdp will basically want to protect no debt uh yeah exactly the no debts issue and the and and merits will want to spend so that will be interesting yeah I think mer wants to spend I think not necessarily in the same way as the spa would I think he would like to spend more in subsidies or like investment or um in the milry or uh but uh probably some deregulations as well but um I don't think he would like to keep that that uh and yeah depends on on also what attitude he wants to take with foreign policy yeah yeah yeah no no no no worries no worries uh very quickly just read the comments so uh Fritz just to your point s supporting merrs yes I know probably probably hates merrs but his latest interview in his latest interview with much grudgement on his face I saw it he was like I'm okay with merrs becoming the Bund the candidate that's literally what he said which means I'm okay with it so so it's hurting him a lot but he is doing it because I think he want I mean because he's the only guy who's pulling higher than mels so but I don't think the national CDU wants another but just just for the audience the CDU has a horrible history with bavarians running for national elections I think with the exception of Armin lashed every time they they put a Bavarian on the ticket it has gone terribly AR lashed wasn't Bavarian was he no exactly with the exception of arm lashed ah okay I meant with like Ed Edmund stobber in 2022 in 20 202 when they lost against sh Fran when they lost against they lost AR too and he wasn't from from Bavaria they that's what I said with the exception of lashed every time they put up okay now I get it now I get it it's late I'm a bit slow thank you no worries no worries got it got it all right everyone um any last final questions uh before we leave it here we're already an hour in time goes quickly um I don't think there is ah here wa very quickly we're elf will you cover Bulgaria's coming election yes we're going to try and cover every EU election so any country in the
