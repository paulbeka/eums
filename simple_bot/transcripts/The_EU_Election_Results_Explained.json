    "transcription": "Hello Europe! Over the last 4 days, more than \n400 million Europeans from 27 EU countries have   hit the polls to choose the next 720 MEP’s \nin the EU Parliament for the next 5 years.   And The results are in! So, what \ndo they look like? Let’s dive in! Alright, so here’s the deal: there are \nhundreds of national parties across all   European nation-states. Yeah, it's a bit of \na party jungle out there. But don’t worry,   we’re not going to go through \nthem one by one. Instead,   we’ll zoom out a bit and look at the \nbigger picture on a European level. You see, these national parties team-up and \nform 7 major European Political Groups. Think   of it as an Avengers-style team-up, but \nfor politics! For instance, in the EPP,   you have Germany's CDU/CSU, Spain's PP, and \nItaly's Forza Italia, among many many others. So, who came in 7th? The LEFT in the European \nParliament group did with 35 seats, representing   left-wing parties all across Europe. Now, keep in \nmind that these results aren't completely final,   but they're accurate to about 98%. The LEFT \ngroup is composed of various parties from   different countries, with the biggest being \nFrance's La France Insoumise with 9 seats,   Greece’s Syriza with 3 seats and \nGermany's Die Linke with 2 seats. So, how did they perform compared to last time? \nThey experienced a small shift, losing 2 seats.   If you want more details about what they \nstand for, check out the video linked above. So, who came in 6th place? \nThe Greens did with 53 seats,   championing environmental and progressive \ncauses. The Greens group is made up of   various parties from across Europe. For example, \nGermany's Bündnis 90/Die Grünen with 13 seats,   France's Ecologists with 5 seats, and \nthe Dutch Groenlinks with 4 seats. So, how did they perform compared to \nlast time? Unfortunately for them,   they took a massive hit, losing 18 \nseats in total. Despite this setback,   they remain committed to pushing for \nenvironmental sustainability and social   justice. If you want more details about who \nthey are, check out the video linked above. So, who came in 5th place? The Identity and \nDemocracy (I&D) group did with 58 seats,   known for their nationalist and eurosceptic \nstance. The I&D group is composed of various   parties from across Europe. The biggest by \nfar is France's National Rally with 30 seats,   followed by the Dutch PVV party with \n7 seats and Italy's Lega with 7 seats. So, how did they perform compared to last \ntime? They saw a noticeable change, gaining   9 seats. This gain would have been a lot more had \nGermany's AfD not been kicked out of the I&D only   a couple of weeks ago, but more in this later. \nThis positions them as a significant force in EU   politics. And if you want more details about what \nthey stand for, check out the video linked above. Before we get to the top 4, have \nyou ever wondered about your own   family's past? This brings me to today's \nsponsor, MyHeritage, a true gamechanger. I started by simply entering information \nabout my parents and grandparents,   and whoop – there it was!

Who knew?\" \"And check this out – I uploaded this old family \nphoto to MyHeritage. Their tools let me repair,   colourize, enhance, and even animate it.

The European \nConservatives and Reformists (ECR) group did with   72 seats, known for their conservative and soft \nEurosceptic policies. The ECR group is composed of   various parties from across Europe. The biggest \nbeing Italy's Brothers of Italy (FdI) with 23   seats, Poland's Law and Justice party with \n20 seats, and Spain's Vox with 6 seats. So, how did they perform compared to \nlast time? They saw a solid performance,   gaining 3 seats. This positions them as an even \nmore significant force in EU politics. And if   you want more details about what they stand \nfor, check out the video linked above. So, who came in 3rd place? Now we have to \nstart Drum roll, please! 🥁 And it is … The   centrist Renew Europe group, known for \ntheir pro-European and liberal stance,   with a total of 83 seats. The Renew Europe \ngroup is composed of various parties from   across Europe. The biggest parties are France's \nRenaissance party and their allies with 13 seats,   Czechia’s ANO party with 7 seats, and \nProgressive Slovakia with 6 seats. So, how did they perform compared to last time? \nThey experienced a significant downward shift,   losing a staggering 19 seats. Nonetheless,they \nare still a major player in EU politics. And   if you want more details about what they \nstand for, check out the video linked above. So, who’s the runner-up? Another Drum roll,   please! 🥁 The centre-left S&D group with a \ntotal of 135 seats. The S&D group consists   the following parties from all across Europe. The \nbiggest are Spain Workers party with 20 seats,   Italy's Democratic Party 19 seats, and \nFrance’s Socialist party with 13 seats. So, how did they perform compared to last \ntime? They actually lost a few seats – 4 of   them. But they won’t be too upset as they are \nstill the 2nd most dominant force. And if you   want more details about what they stand \nfor, check out the video linked above. So, who’s the big winner? A final drum roll, \nplease! 🥁 The centre-right EPP group snagged   the most seats with a total of 189. The \nEPP is made up of loads of parties from   all across Europe! The biggest parties in \nthe EPP are Germany's CDU/CSU with 31 seats,   Spain's PP with 22 seats and Poland’s \nCivic Coalition with 18 seats. So, how did they perform compared to last \ntime? Well, they actually gained loads of   new seats – 13 of them! This makes them \nby far the largest party in EU politics.   And if you want more details about what they \nstand for, check out the video linked above. So, here you have the final overview of the \nEuropean Groups! But, hold your horses—these   are the groups we've had in the previous 5-year \nparliament. National parties might shuffle around,   meaning these numbers can change. And guess what? \nNew groups can form too. There have been rumours   of an ECR-ID supergroup that could catapult \nthem into 2nd place. Or maybe Meloni’s party   will ditch the ECR and join forces with Von der \nLeyen in the EPP group. While both of these moves   are long shots, they're still in the realm of \npossibility. Plus, you may have noticed earlier,   there are 95 MEPs in the non-aligned pile, meaning \nthey do not have a political affiliation yet.   This includes Germany’s AfD and Hungary’s \nFidesz camp. They could jump ship and join   one of these groups to beef them up. What \nI am trying to say is, a lot can change! So, what did we learn? Well, it looks like \nthe right-wing had quite a party! All the   right-leaning groups in the EU parliament gained \nextra MEPs, and that's not even counting the AfD   folks who are currently flying solo. Ursula \nvon der Leyen was the star of the show,   snagging the most seats and adding 13 more to \nher tally from last time. On the flip side,   the Greens and Liberals had a bit of a rough \nnight, losing the most seats. This was so shocking   that Macron is calling for a French election \nafter his poor showing against Marine Le Pen,   and the Belgian Prime Minister even resigned after \nhis party's defeat. But in a nutshell, the EPP,   S&D, and Renew Europe still have the majority if \nyou add up their seats. So, we’ll most likely have   the same coalition as last time.
