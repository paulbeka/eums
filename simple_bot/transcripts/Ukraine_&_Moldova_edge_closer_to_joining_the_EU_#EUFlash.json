    "transcription": "Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Bosnia & \nHerzegovina are making pivotal strides   towards EU membership, as announced by the EU \nPresident last week. Wondering what this all   means? EU Flash will bring you the latest \nupdates, delivered swiftly and simply. Let's take a peek at our Monopoly board to \nassess the progress of these four countries   towards EU Membership. Oh yes, it's a \ncomplex game with 12 steps to reach that   coveted EU Membership status. In reality, \nthere might be closer to a hundred steps,   but here at 'EU Made Simple', we \naim to keep things... well, SIMPLE. So, where does Ukraine stand today? They've just advanced from stage 4 to \nstage 5! The Commission has reported   that Ukraine has accomplished 90% of the \nnecessary steps in the screening process,   which includes judicial reforms \nand anti-corruption measures. Next in line is Ukraine’s neighbour, Moldova, \nmoving from stage 4 to 5. Moldova, praised by   the EU Commission as a 'frontrunner,' has three of \nnine key tasks left: finishing judicial reforms,   boosting anti-corruption measures, \nand enhancing economic strength. The good news? The Commission's recommendation \nfor both countries is “unconditional“,   and we're anticipating a decision from \nthe European Council early December,   potentially propelling both nations to stage 6. And about reaching stage 7? The Commission \nis eager to fast-track. They plan to present   the final recommendations for each \ncountry to EU leaders in March 2024,   hoping to kickstart stage 7 soon after. Yes, that seems a bit far off, but in \nEU terms, that's practically warp speed! Meanwhile, Bosnia & Herzegovina, another stage \n4 candidate, unfortunately rolled a zero this   time – no advancement to stage 5 just yet. The \nCommission is ready to give the green light,   but only if Bosnia can address specific concerns \nrelated to ethnic divisions and judicial issues. And what about Georgia, you ask? They're at \nstage 2, having rolled a 0.5 – the Commission   is recommending candidate status, leaving the \nfinal call for the European Council in December. I can almost hear the buzz in the \ncomments section! Wondering about   other aspiring EU Member States? Well here \nyou go, with the state of play as of today. My dear viewers, by December, we might see two \nnew Schengen Members, more updates on EU hopefuls,   and even a fresh trade deal with Latin \nAmerica. Want to stay on top of it all?
