    "transcription": "everyone at eade simple we are super excited to have our first debate live on our Channel we have some amazing guests with us today three three of them who I'll introduce in a minute and we're covering two big topics so we have EU defense which 40% of you on the channel have said is your number one topic you want to talk about and the next topic we'll talk about is EU reform we've created a lot of videos on this so that's why we're talking about that also today now without further Ado the three guests that we have is first we have she is from Austria and she is from the party NEOS which is Affiliated to Alder which is the European party and the next level up is then renew Europe so thank you for being here anna we appreciate it thank you for the invitation great great and then next we have Damian balaga he is from Germany he's from the party Vault um and yeah they're looking in eventually I think to form their own European party but currently they're Affiliated on the group level with the greens and European free Alliance so hi Damian lovely to have you here thanks for the invite great and then lastly Antonio tanini he's from fora Italia from Italy um and they're Affiliated to the EP group so also Antonio to you great to have you here thanks very much right and we're jumping straight into something called Spotlight so Antonio the spotlight is on you maybe you want to quickly explain what you stand for and why people should go to the polls for you good afternoon everybody my name is Antonio I'm 54 I'm Italian and running for for Italia EP party in the northeast constituency of Italy um I've been working in Brussels in the European system for 20 years now so I've been working from inside the the machine and uh now what I would like to do is to help my country to be more effective in the Europe system in in a time where very important decision will will have to be taken first of all we want the European Union to play a stronger role not only economical as they did so far but also on the political and defense level this is the my my my first point great so defense it's our first topic so you started it straight away so Antonio to to prod you a little bit what do you want to do on defense because um there's some part where it's very clear I think Daman and Anna I'll get to you in a minute you're looking more at a federal European Army but what do the EP and force Italia stand for when it comes to defense so first of all we we stand for a reform of the decision making process we want to move to the majority rule concerning foreign policy for foreign policy yeah so this is a very important because uh it's impossible to have a a common defense policy and common uh foreign policy without I mean with with the veto decision no so um this is a I think the from the decision making side it's the first thing to do to make it simple to take decisions but also um there is much to do on the Industrial Level ER because we think that common defense starts from a common defense industry so we are in favor of European Defense commissioner I think this is something necessary it would be a positive step forward and um it is urgent to set the European Union on such a part immediately so that the result can be seen in the coming years um as far as the military side is concerned ER of course we are in favor of of the support to the to the NATO system but we think that Europe needs to be um needs to play this this game on a more equal food foot compared to the United States right right okay thank you thank you that makes that makes sense it's quite interesting to hear you say that because on the EP level when I read the manifesto I mean I know you're towards Italia part of the EP but I don't see anything about foreign policy and removing the veto so it's surprising to hear that but that's great and maybe maybe we move over to Daman before you Anna Damian do you do you agree with what Antonio said do you want to take a step further what is your perspective on the European Defense issue in terms of integration so I think there are two things to look at one is common procurement and here Antonio already mentioned um that that we should work closer together I think it's very very necessary we have the Munich security conference from I think seven years ago where it was already analyzed that we have 17 different tank systems for the same tank category in Europe that is from you know the scale effects just  so we need to procure together I think that's the first thing the second thing is how do we then you know get to a European Army um and this is really what we want to do we need to basically integrate the European armies in a way that uh they they become one and and then the third point is how do we take decisions on foreign policy and and here I would say um you know Antonio's uh idea is very much still that it's the member states who decide on F policy yeah they decide with you know not with a veto anymore not with unanimity but with the majority vote but they still decide and for me um that's not good enough I think what we need is that European citizens can actually you know vote for European parties that say I want to do this on foreign policy or this on fore policy as on all other areas of policy be it you know Healthcare whatever other policies we want to look at markets and so on trade and and then you should be able to vote as a citizen and have the power and so for us it is clearly a voted European elected European government that has been elected by European parties that should be able to take forign policy decisions um without having to ask a second chamber um on on like what what their decision is okay so Daman just to clarify it straight away like Vault stands for a European Army right they want an EU Army if I underst understand that correctly a European Defense Army under under parliamentary control that's correct but we want that was my next question right yeah yeah but like United foreign policy means not that the member states decide on foreign policy maybe in a different decision- making process but that the European government elected by the European people takes form policy decisions that's a completely different system from what Antonio is saying just to make this very clear okay okay so Antonio is more on the member state level still have to decision you're saying we make the decisions on a higher level on an EU level would that be the correct understanding just to make sure that is correct yes okay um Anna just to pull you into into the conversation so um just to give a bit of background we know that there is um your far right party I think UD UDP I think it is in um in Austria um FP sorry sorry my bad my bad it's first debate so yeah anyway exactly they're getting quite big they're at 30% at the moment and um we saw images on line of zilinsky kissing Ura thunderline like a crazy ad saying War mongerer above it so obviously there's a big well the party does not really support supporting Ukraine and secondly they are also against the EU doing a lot for the Ukraine and um apparently according to polls 30% agree with them are these 30% of people wrong or what what what do don't they see that you do see well listen I think it's a bit difficult to say that 30% of the people vote for them just because of that you know that's that's one issue and I think we have to look at that from a bigger picture I mean we have similar polls in in Germany when it comes to afd um we have national elections coming up in Austria as well in September and we have similar polls there so I think it's a much bigger picture than just the question of whether people want to support Ukraine or not what we do see in Austria which is very interesting and I think slightly different from the other countries here is that we are as most of you will know a neutral country so we as NEOS we stand for the idea of a European Army a defense Army made up of professional soldiers uh this is something that shocked a lot of people when we first called for it in 2019 already um but I think and it saddens me to say I think reality has shown especially now with Russia invading Ukraine it has shown how important this is and this isn't about whether you're neutral or not this is about keeping our people safe and the easiest and best and most efficient way to do that is to do it together uh and so it's not a question of ideology or a question of uh emotional decision- making or anything it is purely the the strategically right efficient decision to make to really work together and to integrate our military so that we can best support and keep our people safe and I think that's what it should all be about and I just conscious of time you just finished anyway so that's that's great we're getting a lot of questions at the moment so the first question and Anna I'll stay with you because you are the last person to answer the last one is and this is from Nile Murray if Trump wins reelection in the United States and continues his isolas R rhetoric pulling the us out of NATO for example what do you think the EU should do to guarantee its defense I mean I think you already answered a little bit but maybe you want to expand a bit to to your answer yeah I would like to do that because in fact we told about this a lot here as well and it's always this question of if Trump wins and I think in a way it's wrong for us to just talk about if Trump wins because I my main fear is that if Trump doesn't win then everyone will lay back again and say oh you know what it's fine the US will deal with it that is not a sensible strategy for security policy uh we can't be reliable or we can't have to rely on the US because they aren't reliable not under Trump but who knows who's going to come next so we need to really be able to stand up for ourselves and not rely on the US no matter what happens there so yes we need a real European Army and not rely on NATO but last question I promise then I go to the other people Anna what one thing though what should isn't it a challenge changing the Austrian mentality there because you're so not you personally but austrians seem to be so culturally ingrained with neutrality you're not part of NATO how are you going to push through an idea of an EU Army or something like that when people are still so well culturally different maybe that's the way best way of saying it well I mean we're doing it step by step uh and I think the important thing is and we've had these conversations over the last few weeks is to just show people neutrality yes is something that our country is but it's not a security policy and that I think is something that we need to start fully talking about and uh as we've seen as well there's been a letter from all the remaining neutral States including Austria to Nato basically saying we need you and we need to work together because we aren't safe uh by ourselves and I think uh that is something that we can work with great thank thank you for your answer yeah Damen if you can make it quick then we can move to the next next question yeah I make it very simple um all our countries have lost their sovereignty when it comes to defense we don't have sovereignty yeah because we can't defend ourselves I served in the German Army I can tell you it's not working and um the the second point just very quickly if the US should pull out of NATO this fall um Europe is defenseless so just let's be very honest about the situation and we would even under Trump need to very heavily work on you know transatlantic relationships when it comes to defense and if you know China attacks Taiwan at some point even then it becomes very difficult with NATO so I would just say like you know wake up a bit people when it comes to defense yeah definitely yeah yeah so I mean it's just to add a little bit on Anna and Damian it is very clear that no single member State can guarantee the safety ER of it Cs and Europe so if Trump Trump trump wins H we need to accelerate our capacity to be coordinated but the first step should be to be stronger inside the NATO to create a stronger coordination in inside the NATO because we have time to to reform the the European Union but the second step would be to go ahead with the reforms but first of all let be more united and coordinated inside the NATO right love it okay let's um let's move on we're getting we're getting quite a few questions and I know this is not part of the topics that we initially discussed but I'm going to ask it anyway um and this is um let me find it God I have to scroll up now um here again so what does EU need to do to tackle migration is addressing migration key to reducing populist parties influence we're getting a lot of migration question so um maybe ask maybe Damian you can start and Antonio you can say something more to it and then we go back to you Anna yeah first of all um we have to separate labor migration Asylum and integration challenges yeah and uh just very quickly on labor migration I mean once the Baby Boomers are going into retirement we have a huge issue the issue is already there 70% of companies in Germany say they can't grow enough because of a lack of talent and this will just become worse so you know we need massive labor migration everybody who tells you something different um is wrong second Point Asylum I think we need a functioning Asylum system I don't think that what we decided on the European level um a month ago is actually going to work so well to be honest it's my personal perspective we need to distribute more across Europe and the last Point integration challenges then shut up I promise we we need I just want to challenge you D I want to challenge you that's why because I mean I don't think people mind the the migration for well some people obviously do but not a a lot don't I think it's all about illegal immigration that people care about right I mean I seen on my channel a lot yeah there's no legal so first of all I'm just I have to talk about Labor migration because everybody you you as well just now when you introduce the question we're saying you know migration do we need to get it under control migration is first and foremost labor migration visas people coming to study and we need to talk about the opportunities and the necessity of Labor migration and if you don't do this first you fall in the Trap of like thinking migration boats that's wrong that's just plainly wrong it's still 400,000 people Daman it's still 400,000 people yes but like it's important how you talk about issues yeah so and then we can talk about Asylum it's a completely different question by labor migration you talk about what can you do for me Asylum you talk about what can I do for you first question you want to uphold the right to seek Asylum not the right to get it but to seek Asylum my answer is yes if you want a yes in this you need Asylum procedures and you need people to go through it either you do it on the borders in camps which are horrible and they're looked at or you do it decentralized in the communes across Europe and I would just say let's do it decentralized in the communes in Europe and then let's try to get people uh you know their decision fast and in Germany the quote I just a quote I just checked is 70% positive Asylum decisions if you looked at so like let's get the narratives also straight when it comes to this and we need to get people into work fast decentralized housing language classes um all these kind of things but let's not you know fall into this Narrative of the far right saying like everything is yeah yeah okay I I get your point um Antonio do you have anything to add 30 seconds before I move to the next question if yes I mean I would take uh your point on the fact public opinion is pretty much affected by illegal migration isues and as an Italian I must say that Italy is in the the Forefront so the most urgent thing to to do would be to to make it possible to really share the burden of all these thousands of people arriving most of all through the Mediterranean because um when they arrive to Italy even to a small island they up to Europe and uh if we don't find an answer to this big issue nobody can solve it all alone we will give a lot of Fe populist parties and and saying that Europe doesn't do nothing on this Europe is is useless you know so I think this is the very urgent to do okay thank you um moving on for migration Anna I'd love to give you the spotlight so uh of what you stand for at NEOS and what you would do or change or want to do um if elected MEP oh you're on mute Anna yeah thank you yeah maybe I'll start by just introducing myself my name is Anna and I'm 30 years old so I'm exactly as old as the Austrian decision to join the EU so I've never known anything but the European Union and the European Union was always a given to me and all the opportunities we have by it and through it however I studied in the UK and it was actually the day that we had our um grad well yeah a graduation that we learned the UK was going to leave the EU so I know what it does to a country when it decides based on populist uh almost disinformation campaigns to leave the EU and so I and my party we want to strengthen the European Union and we don't just want to work on certain problems we want a new positive Vision that we can work towards and that for us is the United States of Europe where we work together to tackle climate change yes also migration issues uh and questions of that uh but also create opportunities and so we one of the big things that we call for is to have education as the fifth freedom in in the European Union that is something that we want to enable and establish and that is what we run for okay all right thank thank you Anna we we got another question from someone um which I'd like to ask and it says with the greens and renew Europe because neon is also part of um of renew Europe would you stand together when it uh coming comes to things like pushing like climate change reform from the EU and EU Army and a tighter grip in the state and media to protect our values so someone would like to know how much cooperation there is between the greens and renew are these are you cooperating on that level is that something you can answer well maybe Damon you wna you w to talk about how it was in the last five years so um so I'm not a green just to make this very clear I'm a vault MEP and um in this you know after the election we will once again negotiate with the greens and the renew group of where we will sit with Vault we will very likely become more MPS and um yeah so just to to clarify that what can I say about the past mandate I think when it comes to EU reform there were some strong voices in the Liberals and some strong voices in The Greens pushing for that um and so I think the groups were nine the question is always a question of priority I have the feeling that people love to talk about Europe in election campaigns um for the Europe election I sit on thousands of panels not thousands but like feels like thousand um and every time I hear everybody on the panel say how important Europe is and then you check who's actually currently in government in in Germany and you see all these three parties doing nothing about improving the European Union so I think it's you know it's always nice to say and and claim you care about Europe but you also need to make it a priority and this is not happening um let's let's move over to the last topic of the or the the second topic which is the last topic and this is EU reform we've already touched it quite a lot with United States of Europe from Anna um and there's a couple of big things I just like to ask where each of you stand I mean we talked about the veto for foreign policy which is Big veto and Tax Matters um I think that's something else that everyone stand here but the third topic I want to get into is the election of our European president so Antonio um maybe I'll ask you first because you haven't answered for a while um some people are very frustrated and myself included I'm a bit confused of why the commission president election is the way it is and it's and I was wondering how where the EP stands is it something you want to reform or is it something that you feel is working High way it is and why uh thanks very much lamberto for this question I can bring you you the position of my party of Mr Tani who's the leader of our party um we in general we want to reform the system to make it more democratic so we would like to to realize two re big reforms the first one um is about the role of the European Parliament we think that to make Europe more democratic we should Grant the European Parliament the the power of initiative because we always explain to the citizens that all the legislative proposals are prepared by the commission the commission is more let's say a technical body while we want the parliament to be a real Parliament to have the opportunity to propose the the the European rules and this is a one of the first thing we would like to propose in case of of an initiative to reform treaties as to your qu to your question um we also think that to make Europe more democratic and most of all more understandable by the citizens the direct election of the president not the president president of the European commission one president okay exactly so we we the idea is would be to only one precedence to merge the European Council and the European commission to have a real European presidence but this is the proposal that Force Italia has discussed inside the EP I cannot say this is the the position of the EP but this is what we like to do yeah just just for my audience I mean I've created a lot of videos all the different groups and I know you're fors Italia it's not exactly that you've agree with everything that the EP does but the EP is very vague in their Manifesto when it comes to things like how to elect the European president so it's interesting to see that for ital has maybe a bit of a different perspective on things um awesome then um Damian I think it's your turn to uh give us a a 60- second Spotlight into what you are all about and priorities thanks lamber so first of all I mean V is a European Party founded founded by an Italian and a French and myself a German because we believe that that we need real European parties and what you just explained about you know the European conservatives and F Italia's position differing that could never happen with Vault because we only have one European electoral program one European foundational program and I mean our priorities for these elections and also the past one were first to reform the European Union and to make it a real Parliament democracy and I can say word to what Antonio just described what differs there a second um we want a more just Society so the right for everyone to love who they want to love but also to ensure minimum social standards across Europe and the third point is that we want an innovation friendly climate neutral economy because we believe that you know the climate goals are not set by the greens or by the UK commission but by the planet and it's also true for our biodiversity gos and but to get there we also need to yeah Foster Innovation and really allow for more harmonized rules across Europe to really you know get the full potential of the interior Market going so we believe that Europe is really just at the beginning um and then we can do much much better and more if we actually elect European governments who have the power to decide um I don't know if I can react to Antonio's point of the direct presidential election if you can in in in 20 seconds then I want to ask the next question from the comment please yeah yeah super quickly I mean um I like what what Antonio said I think for me I don't like presidential direct elections so much yeah we have that in the in France and we have that in the States United States and that's why maybe the one reason why I don't like the term United States of Europe so much because I really like you know if you vote for parties if you go for presidential systems it becomes very ego driven very focused on individuals who are hard to control as we can see with the Trump elections and I would much rather have people vote for European political parties that can then have their Chancellor candidate or their prime minister candidate or the president candidate whatever you want to call it and who can then form a government and afterwards so that is the one difference I see apart from that I think it's exactly the right thing we need to abolish the European Council and we need to get to a functioning parliamentary democracy as we have in all other levels of government great great thank you thank you Daman um just quickly back to the comments um Centura 86 thank you very much for your previous question I didn't thank you for it the next question comes from someone called yakim um and um this is a big one maybe each of you can quickly answer this nuclear energy is apparently a big topic here is this in the eu's future yes or no and then why maybe Anna you would like to start can we do this quickly because then we only have a little time left but thank you yeah I think it's clear that nuclear energy as we have it now is not the energy of the future but it is a energy of the present and I think we we saw in Germany what happens when you turn off all the nuclear plants at once uh now we're back to co I don't think that makes any sense uh and we clearly also still have to invest in um in well any any sort of um way to possibly still go to Fusion Energy that would obviously be kind of the dream um so yeah still invest in it as well great Antonio maybe you would like to go next yeah yes thanks indeed yes we will have nuclear energy in our future but uh first of all we should work to integrate better the the European energy Market which is the first resource we have already available so not to focus only on one source of energy but trying to find the right mix with the objective to have more strategic autonomy uh less dependency from third countries most of all if these third countries are dictatorships and U of course we want to go Greener but we must also go cheaper for our industry and for our citizens so nuclear is for sure part of this big big project awesome and then Daman maybe to to finish that topic off before we go question super quickly I mean we are um very much for looking at each technology very carefully and seeing how it's useful and at the moment it's clear we can't get if you have a europeen grid in mind out of nuclear and but it's also true that if you build a new plan it will take around 15 years and the Giga what whatever you call it hour is more expensive than if you build um other renewable energy so and we don't have you know this waste problem really solved so I would say you know let's focus on tackling the climate crisis and and focus on building a European grid and and green and sustainable energies all right thank you then the next question from jeopard it goes back a topic so we're going back to a European Army it's apparently a Hot Topic here in the comments and he's asking uh maybe Anna maybe start with you um how will an EU how will a European Army join or yeah how will a European army or joint procurement change the political landscape of individual states what about a national Democratic mandate I think what it comes down to is he's asking how will it work um because he's asking here is EU defense just a top- down system is that how it will work in the future there's a lot of questions about this that's why we have to go back to to European Defense sorry about that yeah well there's certainly different ways that we could set it up and um we are still open to discussing which way would work best for um especially kind of the setup that we have right now uh but what we see is the importance of having one European professional Army so made up by professional soldiers and yes that would be under the command of the European Parliament and also a a European chain of command uh and not uh within the nation states whether you still have units within the nation states um that is a different question that we need to look at uh separately um but I have to say we are so far from having a European Army that I think it's important to now take the first steps for a common procurement for common training as well um so let's take those steps uh and and hopefully we'll get to the European Army in the end yeah yeah I I think I'm going to go to the next question because we already covered this a little bit um and we only have 5 minutes left so this could potentially be the final question and this is from um Eco and and he's asking is a commonly agreed upon industrial policy what is needed to reduce the influence of populist parties and dependence on China and the USA so I think it's all about industrial policy about economics so maybe when we go to Economic Policy um Damian I think we haven't talked to you for a while what do you see there in your perspective and from Vault so Europe and especially Germany is um very dependent when it comes to procurement um so Supply if you want Supply chains as well as demand so whatever we sell and export from from China and I think you know that that is just not a good risk strategy so what I would say is like we do need to have more trade agreements with different geographies and I think that's the first point the second point is I'm not a big fan of like throwing money behind big businesses as mcon and Schultz have been now proclaiming last week I think that's not we don't need European Champions to be just even bigger and stop our competition law but we need need to Foster new Industries and startups and scale-ups and that we can do in the climate tech industry by yeah reducing the burden uh by harmonizing rules across Europe by allowing for more Talent so um basically labor Migration by ensuring that there's funds by you know uniting the capital markets and the banking Union and yeah maybe investing in with the European Investment Bank and guarantees for loans and and yeah by not yeah undermining the State um Aid and the competition law and what about for Italia Antonio is that a bit different do you want to invest directly into big companies or you see completely differently uh no well I on the competition policy um we think it is still a fundamental pillar of European economy but we think that these rules have been written when China and India were not uh as big as they are now so uh we think that we need more um more European Champions and somehow we have to uh refresh the the competition rules the European competition rules to make it possible to have a more European Champions industrial Champions than able to to challenge to compete with China and American and Indian competitors but also we have to remind that the back B of our economy is small and medium Enterprises so we need to really help them to to face the the big challenges of energy prices and and third countes competition so we would do these two steps thank you Antonio and uh Neil's perspective Anna very quickly and then we'll move to closing statements just so conscious of time yeah well I actually can support 100% what Daman said um this is very much out position as well so maybe I'll just specify one or two things which is uh you mentioned lifting the burden I think it's really important that um with every single law that we make with every single regulation we make sure that they are done in a way that burdens our companies the least in where where um where possible um but second of all when we talk about investment we want to be specific here we want what we call the um and a SP so a quot future quota or a quota for future which is nothing else than say that at least 25% of the EU budget so every fourth Euro should go towards the future that is either education Renewable Energy Research and uh Innovation and this for us uh is a very specific and very concrete thing that we need to do and we need to see in the next five to 10 to 15 years thank you Anna and um that wraps it all up so maybe very quickly uh last 30 seconds each if you'd like to make any closing statement there quite a lot of people in the room so thank you for all the questions by the way from everyone in the room there's a lot more but we might do this again in the future so maybe who could you start with Antonio let's start with you if you you have 30"
