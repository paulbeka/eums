Instead, we’re zooming in \non the regional elections in two eastern states,   Thuringia and Saxony. Now, you might be \nthinking, “Why should I care about some   regional elections in Germany?” Well, let \nme tell you, these results could be a sneak   peek into next year’s national elections \nand might even send ripples across the EU.  And, wow, were these results fascinating! \nImagine this: a far-left conservative populist   (yes, you read that right—left-wing \nand conservative combined) and a   far-right party both scoring big wins.\nBut before we dive into the juicy details   of these election outcomes and their \npotential impact on Germany and beyond,   let’s take a quick detour to explore \nthe intriguing world of German politics. Germany’s political system operates on a \nprinciple known as federalism. At its core,   federalism means that power is divided between the \nnational government (the federal level) and the 16   individual states, known as Länder. Each of these \nLänder has its own parliament and government,   giving them significant autonomy to \nmake decisions on various issues.  The federal government also has a \nparliament, called the Bundestag,   and handles nationwide responsibilities like \nforeign policy, defence, immigration laws,   and taxes. Meanwhile, the Länder have control \nover education, policing, cultural affairs,   and healthcare, allowing them to tailor these \nareas to the specific needs of their populations.  This balance of power allows \nGermany to maintain national   unity while respecting regional diversity.\nIn regional elections, like those in Thuringia and   Saxony, the residents have the opportunity to vote \nfor representatives in their state parliaments,   known as the Landtag. But here’s where it gets \ninteresting—German voters actually get two votes!  To show you how this works, let's dive into \na real example from last Sunday's elections.  This is Thuringia, one of the two states where \nvoters went to the polls. Thuringia is divided   into 44 electoral districts, and we’ll focus \non Sömmerda, district number 17, as an example.  In this district, voters cast their first \nvote for a direct candidate within their   local electoral area. The candidate who gets \nthe most votes wins a seat in the Landtag,   securing what’s known as a \ndirect mandate. In Sömmerda 2,   this went to Mr. Czuppon from the AfD party.\nNow, if we look at Thuringia as a whole,   44 seats in the Landtag are filled by these direct \nmandate winners from each district's first vote.  But the second vote is even more important \nbecause it determines the overall composition   of the state parliament. With this vote, people \nchoose a party rather than a specific candidate.  Now, looking at Thuringia as a whole, most people \nused their second vote for the AfD, followed by   the CDU and BSW. To ensure proportionality, \nadditional seats are added to the parliament   so that the overall representation matches \nthe proportion of votes each party received.  This system balances direct representation with \nproportional representation, ensuring that both   the local favourites and overall party \npreferences are reflected in the Landtag.  Yes, yes, it’s over-engineered and a bit \ncomplicated. But hey, we’re talking about   Germany here—what else would you expect?\nSo, if we add the 1st vote and 2nd vote   results together, these are the \nelection results in Thueringen,   with the AfD clear winners with 32 seats, followed \nby CDU with 23 seats and then BSW with 15 seats.  As you can see, the far-right AfD emerged as \nthe winner. This outcome might be influenced   by the recent deadly knife attack in Solingen, \nGermany, which tragically claimed three lives   and left eight others seriously injured. \nThe Islamic State terrorist group claimed   responsibility for the attack, leading to \nwidespread, though varied, media coverage. Ground News found nearly 460 sources covering \nthis from across the political spectrum and   the world. And sorting through their \ncoverage, I can see how the German   government is focusing on how this attack put \na spotlight on the nation’s deportation laws. I can either click to read through their coverage \nor keep scrolling for a broader perspective like   UK-based Financial Times reporting on how the \nstabbings rekindled the EU’s far-right fears. This attack could have a profound impact \non the upcoming regional elections,   swaying public opinion depending \non where you get your news from. Which is where today's video sponsor truly excels. \nGround News is an innovative app and website that   compiles related news from across the globe so \nyou can see how different outlets cover the same   story.

The \nclear losers in this election were the FDP, who   failed to secure enough votes and ended up in the \n\"Others\" category, followed by the Left, Greens,   and SPD, who also performed poorly.\nThe left-wing conservative BSW claimed   third place, securing 11.8% of the \nvote, which translates into 15 seats.  In second place was the far-right AfD, which \ngarnered 30.6% of the vote and won 40 seats.  Leading the pack, the centre-right CDU \nemerged victorious with 31.9% of the vote,   earning them 42 seats.\nWhen we look at the recent   election results in Thuringia and Saxony, the \nstandout winners are the AfD, CDU, and BSW. For those who have been living under \na rock, the AfD is Germany’s far-right   party. Their lead candidate in Thuringia, \nBjörn Höcke, is even more extreme than most   within his party. He is even facing \nlegal action for using Nazi rhetoric. In Saxony, the CDU emerged as the winner. The CDU \nis Germany’s center-right party and serves as the   main opposition to the current federal government. \nIt’s the party of notable figures like former   Chancellor Angela Merkel and the current President \nof the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. BSW, or Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht, is particularly \nintriguing because this party didn’t exist just a   year ago. Led by Sahra Wagenknecht, a prominent \nleft-wing politician formerly associated with   The Left party, BSW seeks to challenge the \ntraditional party landscape. They advocate for   a mix of left-leaning economic policies, such \nas social justice and wealth redistribution,   alongside more conservative stances \non immigration and cultural identity. The real challenge now is determining \nwhich parties will form coalitions   in Saxony and Thuringia, a task \nmade especially difficult by the   fact that all parties have ruled \nout collaborating with the AfD. Nonetheless, in Thuringia, a potential \ncoalition could involve the CDU, BSW, and SPD. In Saxony, the most likely coalition options   are either a CDU-BSW-SPD alliance \nor a CDU-BSW-Greens partnership. However, forming these \ncoalitions will be challenging,   as these parties have fundamentally \ndifferent ideologies and priorities. Now that you’ve probably learned more about \nGerman state elections than you ever wanted to.  So what does it all mean for Germany and the EU? In the short term, not much will change. But in the long term, things could shift significantly. Take Germany’s ruling coalition—the SPD, Greens, \nand FDP. They didn’t just underperform in   Thuringia and Saxony; they did terribly! There’s \ngrowing pressure on the German government to call   for new elections, and these results might just \nadd fuel to that fire. Even if they hang on,   Germany’s next scheduled elections are next \nyear, whcih could see them suffer heavy   losses. Current polls suggest the CDU will \nwin, with strong gains for the AfD and BSW. While the CDU remains firmly pro-Ukraine \nand pro-EU, their talk of tightening border   controls could put them on a collision course \nwith the EU. But considering that very few seem   to be happy with the European migration, \nthis could also be seen as a good thing. As for the AfD and BSW, they’re even more \nat odds with the EU. Both are critical of   support for Ukraine, and the AfD wants to abolish \nthe euro and possibly exit the EU altogether. So, the next year is shaping up to \nbe very intriguing, with Germany—the   powerhouse of Europe—navigating \nuncharted political waters. But - what do you think?
