    "transcription": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen I believe that we are live always have to check the audio before we start so that everything works perfectly fine um let me know in the chat if everything sounds all right Villa says hello welcome welcome guys it's a pleasure to always have you here um all good that's what I like to hear no issues on the technical side look we have many we had had a great discussion already going in the in the chat about people talking about the EU referendum very interesting well anyways there's plenty to talk about so uh because my internet and my voice sounds clear let's get right into it so today we're going to be talking about of course as the video title suggest or the live stream title suggest we're going to be talking about the movan presidential elections and the EU referendum that happened and as many of you that are following right now know it was very close it was very um nail-biting I believe especially for the people that went up or stayed up until the entire evening um from a know I saw the Articles already saying no it's definitely going to be a no to a yes with 0.4% margin which is um which is incredible and definitely a happy time for people that want mdova in the European Union hi from Romania hi from gagaa hello it's great to all have you here okay and of course I'm not going to be doing that alone um first of all with a piece of uh software we have here of our beautiful map I believe this is from the um government of mova itself with the parliament or the referendum results and the presidential election results uh to try and try and visualize a bit how it how it all is looking here hello uh everyone so many we have people from all over the European Union you love to see it hi from the Czech Republic hi from Germany hi from Soka guys welcome welcome so um we have the well honestly everybody knows the Wikipedia article here but it's very clear so I thought it it's useful to um use it as a resource here um and then we have the map and then we have an overview of all the parties so um of course I'm not going to be doing that alone um we have an incredible guest today with us two um first of all I'm going to be talking with eulia San the do correspondent for mova and later on um we're going to be talking with Alexandre e the radio Liberty Moldova director so two incredible guests and probably very knowledgeable about anything to do with mdova and hopefully a bit as well um with their relationship with the European Union but um I'm very honored and happy to introduce Julia Saron welcome to the show how is it going hello uh thank you for your invitation and I hope we'll have a really interesting conversation for your viewers now mine too so hello everyone um let me say some things about me first maybe yes please yes please go ahead to introduce myself to your public so my name is Julia San as yot said I'm from Republic of mova kishino working here living here uh I raised uh in a small village from Republic of mova uh I'm a journalist uh working in this field like for six years almost and um recently from Recently like I'm a dut Val correspondent from kishino U mostly I'm covering politics topics but also social and I think this is from me yeah wonderful uh it's it's great to have you here of course so um I before we get into um all the details and specifics I was really wondering what are your first reactions to these results like what is what your first thoughts thoughts I'm very curious to know so the biggest concern was more about the referendum than the presidential elections because um like yesterday night was pretty tense uh because of the results we didn't know uh will if the referendum will pass or not uh but as you know or maybe you don't but I'll tell you what for us is very important this referendum especially because um it means um we will have a smooth path let's say like this uh towards the European Union as we are struggling now to join the European Union so it was pretty intense um hard night let's say like this a lot of work but in the end the results as you see more than 50% for yes yep and it's quite quite the margin with uh zero neck to neck basically yeah absolutely and throughout the night if I'm correct it was looking like no was going to come out on top but um throughout throughout the night apparently a lot of votes votes came in for yes yeah yes they were from uh diaspora actually okay yeah from outside of mova right yes people okay from other countries but movans okay very good um I want to turn to the chat real quick um so for everyone um we would like to answer your questions and I believe once we get into the uh into the actual questions many more will follow so um I can't answer all of them unfortunately we have limited time so if you have your question that you really want answered please make sure to tag us first of all with at e made simple and if you really have a burant question make sure to use the Super Chat function so that um we will dedicate the time to answering your questions anyways so me as an outsider um I haven't followed movan politics for very long uh so I was very curious if we look at the let's say the parties or like the the candidates um who are the let's say the top four top five party/ people because um before really reading into all of the the politics I had I had no idea could you take us a bit into who these parties are and of course the main players so um most people will probably know Sandu Maya um or yeah but anyways yes please go ahead but you can be it let's go yeah of course you can say bit more yes Mar Sando is the actual president right now but she's also the candidate from U the P party um let me say you but um B is a pro-european party uh we are focused mostly uh on pro-european integration uh this is like something very important for myand especially and her party because uh she kind of promised to the people of mova but Republic of mova will be able to join European Union until 2030 so in a few years yeah uh what more we are focused on anti-corruption and judicial reform um about this judicial reform is very important to say that um it's a very discussed subject on Brussels too so um let's say our partners are really keeping on an eye on uh how the government is implementing this judicial reform in Republic of mova uh what else economic modernization and social welfare improvements this is also something very important for them uh so about Alexander St he will be uh in the second tour with myand yes because they had the most votes both right yes yes yes yes yes so um he's is the ex General prosecutor of Republic of malova and now he's running for the presidency from p is a party pro- Russian party policy um and hiding under sovereignty and neutrality something like this where really uh for the neutrality of the Republic of mova uh I could say anti NATO or something like this it's uh really um how I can say sensitive subject yeah okay and is it correct that I read that he and a few others have boycotted the EU referendum as well yes yes um Alexander stogo uh did didn't vote for the referendum he actually didn't touch the um okay I forgot the word the referendum the paper with the referend okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he voted only for the presidency okay uh and he said that he is boycotting the the referendum because he's against European integration although though he has a Romanian passport which M makes him a Romanian citizen but Romania is in the European Union so Alexander sto is a a European citizen let's say like this yeah you could say like makes sense for you yeah no it makes sense uh but um correct me if I'm wrong I thought I read somewhere that he was boycotting it yes but he did say maybe as part of the Neutrality Act to say I do see Moldova with a European future do you are you aware of or is that just a facade yes but this statement came today I see okay he said he's boycotting the referendum yesterday but he made this uh another state statement as you said today so okay interesting all right so those those are the top two definitely they will have a runoff so for the people that don't know um I believe in in mova you need 50% of the vote in order to plus one uh% plus one plus one ah plus one uh in order to um get elected as as president and because no one reachs that 50% threshold plus one there will be a runoff and that is I believe in two or one week two weeks no in two weeks okay on Sunday yeah okay um and then just um just to get a an image of the the third person here we have um I am going to Pusher these names USAA rato um with 13.8% of the vote um is there anything that you can say about him um of course he's not going to be relevant in two weeks anymore but just yes yes yes yes he was the mayor of uh BS c um BS is like if I can say like this North Capital of mova something like that an important city from Republic of mova um he um what more about him he was a long period uh in Russia but he was uh very active uh on social media he always had something to say about uh the uh potic in mova about the politicians and now as you saw he was running for the the president this is him and what is his party it it says on Wikipedia is our party but um yeah yes the name is our party ah here PN yeah yeah yes our party socially conservative uh opposed to integration okay okay interesting um okay so that's very good to know that we know at least the three main players there's a few questions from our live chat which I would like to ask you as well um we see oh okay that's okay yeah sure let's move to that topic um we have Norwegian potato as a user username asks um what does Yulia eulia see as the biggest obstacle moving forward with the EU application so that for the viewers that means we're switching topics to the second voting that happened so um that was the referendum but is there any obstacles that you see moving forward from now um from now on uh I think we can be pretty Optimist like um because we saw also today uh a lot of messages coming from abroad from our ex extern Partners yes like from the president of the European Parliament or from the president of European commission Ula wonderline and Roberta metsola they had today uh pretty strong statements uh and they congratulated movan people uh and our current president president um about this referendum about the results yes they are not like they were expected but it's a yes in the end and as we have this support we can be uh pretty Optimist and um I don't know if we will be a member of the European Union until 203 but um for now at least I'm sure we are on the right path yes towards the European Union maybe it's good to tell people what the referendum actually was about because um obviously this referendum wasn't on should the uh should Moldova join let's say tomorrow uh but it was yeah yeah yeah go ahead go ahead explain what it was about um really shortly the referendum was about if people of mova want the Constitution to be modified in order um to for mova to access the um European Union to join the European Union and make this our um most important Point say like this in simple words yeah the most important go okay yes like so um because this was important uh for um uh for uh our partners to see if um they they are supporting us but I guess they wanted to seee or they needed to see if people of mova want to join the European Union and it's not a only a political will MH you know yeah yeah of course to have a look at if the population also supports it um yes I I would like to like I would like to ask your question a bit more specifically on this because there have been messages from both the media and also the um government itself the presidency itself that there was a quite a large amount of let's say electoral interference or uh fraud or let's say influence out from outside s to call it nicely what is your idea on that because there are reports that up to 300,000 people could have been bought um for the results on this election please go ahead yeah this statement made the my do today actually on her if her first briefing was after midnight so today was the second one y in her second briefing she said this um and uh yeah she said 300,000 votes were bought by an organized uh criminal group uh she didn't named anyone but uh what I can say is that only a few days before the elections uh authorities announced about Russia's strong interference and attempt to pay people to vote against the referendum uh and they did it with help of our fugitive oligarch yes uh so uh more uh also our our authori said that uh almost a network from almost 100 people were trained in Moscow and in balans to create destabilization in Republic of mova so um this is about Russia's interference I think it was um where goal to for the referendum to not pass but uh yeah um wait can you still hear me yes I do good good good okay okay so sorry uh my audio just glitched out for a moment there all right so there were statements of this election and it was I mean if I'm not mistaken there is about a 3 million population of mova itself so that would mean 300,000 is roughly 10% of people or at least are allegedly um influenced directly with money by this AR right that that sounds like to me it sounds like a lot uh like a like a big surp surprise in this case that almost 10% our authorities said uh what um this struggle of Russia costs it almost 100 million euros um but of course we don't know for sure the numbers and is is there to your knowledge a any um like public investigation or any let's say charges that are being yes and my son also said today that our authorities uh should uh came up with more details but uh I think um they are still investigated okay investigating and they'll come up with uh upgrades updates sorry updates okay um so I would like to move back over again to the presidential elections um because I'm very curious once again as an outsider it is difficult sometimes to know why people are voting for a certain person or for a certain party could you maybe tell us a little bit more about what topics were the the main um yeah what were the main topics during this presidential election what were the yeah why why did movans go to vote obviously um ex next to the EU because I believe that is obviously a big a big item um when it comes to the referendum but please um I think the topics were almost the same like in every elections okay because the situation uh the political situation is a bit changed but the economic one is still like rough and the most discussed topics um and used in the election campaign were of course um about the salaries uh the poverty uh Pro Russian parties had a wall campaign to denigrate the LGBT community also uh of course our topic was about neutrality as I said before yep uh sure there were many false narratives about the uh European integration uh so one of them was that if we manage to join in the European Union we will lose our national identity which is uh false right I there was there were quite a few let's say interesting messages uh surrounding the European Union like flying the lgbtq like the pride flag was it 12 times a year or something like that I I I saw I saw an article saying that that will happen if mova would have would join the European Union um which is obviously not true anyways I'm going to turn um to the to the to the audience here for a second because there's many questions and people are very interested in anything that's going on um let's see here um this one is not very related to what we're talking about uh what is what is the chance of all anti-eu parties joining forces to oppose Sandu on a second term or is there too much difference between the opposition parties asks user blue cheese you say a little bit about the opposition uniting against a sec or a term of Sandu again um yes these are political predictions which can't really make but I don't know if the electorate from p uh from um uh sh group also yeah okay let's say the hypothetic yeah yeah hypothetically if they are united is it could be a risk for my sandal uh but as you see she has 42% of the voters I mean let's wait for the debates we are really waiting to see the debates between my Sando a and her opponent opponent Alexander stogo and uh let's see um what they will say and uh then we could discuss about people opinion in this regard so oh there so there's going to be some major debates in the coming in the coming days um because they are the two they should be yeah they should do it yeah yeah okay interesting thank you um then there's a question from user hjv he asks why or they ask why was transnistria allowed to vote with this um election or was the influence of this region um what what is the influence of this region on the vote so um maybe for the people that don't know should give a very short background on transnistria we could because it's it's a bit of a special situation within mova I believe um and then maybe we should answer the question what was their influence during these elections and referendum well um let me say first for him her but uh transnistria is Republic of mova transnistria is not a separate country people from transnistria they are m as well and they have the right as I have the right to vote so we are all a big happy happy family if I can say like this uh I mean we are together we are one country we are not separate countries for them to know just to know uh and also we were um at some SE voting section uh on the elections day and we actually spoke to people from uh B region and uh you'll be surprised but U uh people from transnistria also want to join the European Union because we are starting to understand that the European Union um is not something bad and is actually something uh good for the economics especially uh something good for the trades uh this means also money so yep interesting I I I wouldn't have guessed that um okay well um seeing as we are almost on the end of our time I would like to ask you is there anything that you would like to say anything that you would like to shout out um as we move move on um in a few minutes to our next guest um I'd like to invite you to visit Republic of mova all of you because we are a small country with a big heart so if you want you have to come you have to what to see we have good food good mod but after the the elections after the elections okay well it was it was great I mean I don't know if I can speak for everyone that is watching right now but I would definitely want to visit mova it is definitely on the top of my wish list um but we'll see maybe after the election okay Julia I want to thank you very much and um have a great evening I I I I I'm sure you need some rest after that long night of following the referendum yes yes okay you two thank you for inviting me byebye bye bye all right um ladies and Gentlemen please do not go anywhere because in about five minutes we will have our second guest um which is once again for the people that missed it Alex Alexandro e and I am very bad at these names uh the he is the radio Liberty uh Moldova director so we have still plenty of to go so any questions that you guys didn't get answered uh my apologies but please ask them to our next guest because he will be equally as uh interesting let's see what I missed because there are quite a few comments and thank you all for uh for your great questions already um let's see Joker says another thing they scare us um is that joining EU it would mean war with Russia that is that the messaging that is going on inside of mdova that is interesting um please for like I I'm also very curious personally for any movans that we have a chat um what are your thoughts what are your what happened um any feelings happy sad looking forward to um maybe EU membership in the future I'm I'm I'm very curious please invite next time someone from Ala TV they are a specialist and political adviser I think if I'm not mistaken no okay not not AV TV I uh I invited someone else it was uh from another mova broadcast but um un fortunately or unfortunately in in in your case Jo Jo Joker um only de and radio Liberty responded so um let's see I don't see any uh I don't see any movan comments yet um NATO lgbtq plus interesting username asks why was this referendum necessary if it doesn't influence anything um it does definitely influence something um as the movans voted on whether or not this should be uh amended in the Constitution joining the European Union and that will be put into the Constitution that that is their overall goal and let's say mission to make that happen so I would say definitely more than nothing definitely about something um mova here if the elections wouldn't be rigged 65% um plus would be proe says Doran yeah that's I would be very interesting to see after all of that said all of it is said and done and the investigations has been have been concluded to see how much actually the um the Russian or at least outside influence influen this vote right because we have we have a very slim margin of 0.4 or 0.39% um John asks is uh how is the presidential second round expected so um we're gonna have to have the two top candidates and according to at least Our Guest sanday has a a very good chance of succeeding I mean she is already at 42% uh 42.4% right so um here we go okay um I believe uh our second guest will be joining soon so uh ladies and gentlemen I will ladies and gentlemen we are back with our second guest for tonight and it is not just any guest it is um Alexandre e and you have to correct me if that is the wrong pronunciation because um I am not the best at pronouncing these names um he is the uh mdova director for radio Liberty if I'm not mistaken and it is a great pleasure to have him on the show Alexandre welcome yeah thank you thank you for having me and yes your pronunciation is good my name is Alexandro e i lead the movan service of Radio free Europe Radio Liberty since 2022 but I have been with with with with the organization of the radio for more than 20 years first as a correspondent in Moldova uh then as a bureau chief in kisho that's the capital city of mova and then I moved to the headquarters of the radio for Europe in Prague so I have been doing journalism all my life uh I started as a crime reporter at the end of the 90s and then I became a politics correspondent which which some say was pretty much the same bit at that time not much of a difference between the two bits crime and and politics in in mova so this is who I am in in a few words very good it's it's very interesting and it's a it's honestly very very cool to have you on the show because um you sound you are exactly the person that we're looking forward to answer all of these burning questions um just for your information there are uh it's a live stream so we have a few um live Chatters as well there are many people um already commenting that um they're very excited to have you on and uh sometimes there will be a question from the chat so if it's on topic I will try to include it so um but if you don't feel comfortable answering it just feel free to say so it's all good so I would like to start out with just your initial reaction um is it what you expected what are your first thoughts after um let's the the final votes were counted this afternoon if I'm not mistaken um I spent all my night explaining to the colleagues from other countries from other services how movans count votes uh because uh the central election Committee in kisho in mova uh it is posting uh in real time the results as they come in and as they count them and uh the central election committee has been doing this for the last 15 years or so and always at the beginning uh when they start counting the vote come from polling stations in Russia Moldova has a diaspora in Russia in the former Soviet Union and at the beginning you see the pro Russian forces Pro Russian parties really at the top I see and then as the count Counting of the votes progresses throughout the night you see them going down and the pro Western forces coming up on the on top um so uh the votes we knew the results then uh this morning at about 7:00 in mova everything was clear U myand the current president won the first round of uh presidential elections and the yes vote in a referendum uh for mova joining the European Union won with a really Slim razor slim Merin so so um it was a sleepless night night for for me and for many other colleagues it was a dramatic night emotional but we knew that this is going to happen by the morning we'll see a different result okay so so it was it was a emotional roller coaster however it was expected that at least it will be a bit more balanced when exactly night game all the polls uh in the last few months and the average of the PO polling data suggested that uh Maya Sandu may even win from the first round of the vote and that in the referendum a majority of movans about 60% or so or even more will say yes uh to changing the movan Constitution so that the country can join European Union even though this referendum was a little bit bizarre and the idea itself was a little bit strange referendum after you negotiate with the European Union and when the negotiation is done then you go to people and ask would you like to join in these conditions yeah now as we say in in Romanian uh they they sort of put the carriage in front of horses right referendum and then and then negotiations and so on yeah so a little bit deeper on that a user in our live chat asks uh a user named Villa asks um do we expect a higher turnout or a lower turnout considering how different the results were uh to the opinion polls and considering the Russian interference and that's a topic on its own um but we can dive deeper into that a bit later yeah we can talk and talk about this Russian interference uh when it comes to referendums um this is the second time that Moldova holds a constitutional referendum which means the result has a an on the Constitution the Constitution needs to be changed if the yes vote prevails uh the first time it was held in in about 14 or 13 years ago and the people were asked if they want to change the Constitution so that the president of the country is elected directly in the popular vote and that referendum failed because of the law turnout this time the turnout was pretty high uh if when I mean for for a referendum people do not show up in the referendums uh they often don't see the point uh but the turnout was pretty high uh if you look at the previous referendums in mova if you compare it with what people said in the polls is like not really low but you know when a poer comes to you and ask uh you would you go to vote of course uh people don't say I don't I don't want to vote or whatever do my duty or so they would say yes but then uh when it comes to the vote uh they will not go many times okay interesting there's another question about the the turnout a user terminate Terminator 12 asks I uh noticed the age group 66 uh and between 7 75 had by far the largest turnout is there a particular reason for this I'm not sure if that data is correct but let's assume it is why is it among the let's say older uh parts of the population that the Turner was higher um people had to choose when they go to the polling stations do they vote in presidential elections and referendum or or only in one of each yeah and um and and and I'm I'm not sure which uh data your uh viewer is is quoting on the referendum or on the elections but okay traditionally older people they go to vote traditionally older people go to vote they see it uh I mean they have more time this is what is happening in mova for forever uh older people they go to polls and they often decide younger people do not and then they complain but but but yeah this is this is a a thing that happened pretty much in all elections okay yeah no I think in general around at least for Europe This what I can say is that the older Generations they tend to vote more um but was was this this election together with the referendum was it a big topic amongst younger people because I believe uh I believe reading somewhere that it was a large issue among younger voters especially the EU referendum could you say a bit more about that a lot of uh a lot of movan Voters uh they don't actually reside in mova mova has a population a a small population and a lot of uh of its population immigrated mostly in Europe uh um many people were working in Russia in Moscow but since the start of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and even before that since the annexation of Crimea they started coming back home and going towards uh West um so U these people they are sort of movers and shakers young people active people um and they live in Western countries so if you look at the turn uh turnout and at who and how voted in the presidential elections and referendum in diaspora you can see that the the the the the the data are different not 75 65 75 years old but young young people I don't know how much of a of an issue this was amongst M young movans who live in mova they tend to be not that interested in politics um yeah and uh uh and uh they were not a Target uh if I mean I think that the P party the governing party the party of President Sandu did not engage these voters they thought that they have their vote they didn't fire up these people to come to to poll and say their opinion at the polling stations okay so it's difficult to judge but from what we see uh the campaign is sort of lame um uh the government was saying Russia is meddling buying up votes and stuff like that but okay Russia is meddling but Russia is talking to your people to your population and we didn't see from the government from president and from the yes part side of things in the referendum going amongst these people and and talking to them and and and and really engaging engaging this voters yeah so that this part was missing this engagement with the the people that are more likely or were going to vote no in in your opinion you would have liked to see a bit more of I guess maybe discussion or maybe trying to include them in the process we didn't see uh politicians Pro European politicians Pro Western politicians engaging young voters we saw them going in the countryside talking to people living there we never saw them talking with students in in kisho in other parts of the city we we just didn't they assumed that these people are on social media and they will reach them on social media but of course they'll give they they'll give a like to a post but they will not go to vote afterwards they think about you know their own you know immediate issues not necessarily about the problems that politicians have okay that makes sense um we already mentioned it a few times but the um I I would like to hear your um let's say analysis or opinion on the claims coming from the current government and also a few news organizations about the up to 300K votes being bought or being influenced at least in some way by Russia um could you say a little bit more about that we talked about it with our previous guest she mentioned a uh either exiled or Le at least disgraced um oligarch fugitive yeah um could yeah what what is your what is your opinion on that um we um have been seeing protests in kisho in mova since 2022 organized by the shore party this party is led by The Fugitive oligarch Ilan Shore he has been living in Israel then he moved to Russia but he is in hiding because he was convicted in mova for financial crimes okay and uh he's organizing opposition against the current government from abroad he created several parties in mova and they started a with the help of Russia and that help was really clear in 2022 in the fall when the prices of energy were went yeah and like 300% in mova and they wanted to bring people to protest in in the streets to topple the pro Western Government for Russia it was important to have somebody in the back of Ukraine a friend and mdova was not a friend of Russia at that time when it's still not not a friend of Russia today so uh they started the their actions against this government then and a lot of journalists uh uh documented cases that they are paying people to come to the protests it was assumed this time uh that they will be paying people to vote uh because uh the examples of buying votes we saw in Gia gagaa is a small autonomy in the south of mova and they are well always voting with PR Russian parties they never voted for Shore party and Shore has never been there organ you know holding political rallies before there were cases documented cases and there are in courts right now that people have been paid in elections in local elections in gagaa in 2022 now uh it was assumed that they will try to uh replicate the same thing at the scale of the entire country um there are few uh investigations by the prosecutor prosecutor's office the prosecutor's office said in at the beginning of October that only in in September alone they uh saw that uh sure through Russian Banks and through some International schemes because there are no direct relations between the banking system of mova and Russia since mova joined the Western sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine they saw that sh is sending money on various cards through various accounts to about uh they're sending about $15 million to to to a huge amount of people in mova so this is what we know from the government from the prosecutor's office and then there have been a couple of Investigations journalists infiltrating uh this supporters of The Fugitive oligarch and they are openly discussing about getting money but you can pay people to like your election staff or your staff you get you just it's difficult to prove that there was anything like that my S the president of the country uh after the election after the first results came in last night she took a huge pause huge break and then uh at 1 a.m. in the morning she said that they have proofs that uh Russians and Shore paid 300,000 voters yeah at that time it seemed like the referendum was going to failed I mean the yes vote Yes will fail by the morning the yes Camp won so right now she's not talking about the fraud anymore because that would mean invalidating the results I see okay yeah so so she stepped down the rhetoric of it being a fraud we have seen a lot of Russian involvement in terms of propaganda and information and manipulation every day almost every day the spokeperson of the foreign U Ministry uh in Russia Maria zaharova was you know seen speaking about mova about the dictatorship in mova and so on and so forth yeah we saw that a massive U information campaign and we saw it also on social not on social media on the messaging apps telegram also on on some Russian language apps on Tik Tok but when it comes to buying voters we don't know we we should see the of the investigation I mean um to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here um of course I I I I have no doubt that there's definitely some interference going on but um it still probably remains that a large part of the population did vote no because that's what they believe right that's not not not not everyone was bought for during these uh elections what is the main motivation or what is the main movement of these people to vote know in such an election because for me as an outsider which could be very naive I always thought that the prospect of mova wanting to join the EU was pretty popular um at least from an outsider's perspective yeah I I think uh the referendum was pretty I mean it it was not the right moment I mean each people would like to vote to to join the European Union but they needed time to really understand what this means okay and you have this time when you negotiate the uh the joining the EU and the negotiations take long and a society gets used to what is going to be in the European Union right now in a short amount of time uh Russian propaganda used a a series of narratives it's not about buying votes it's about saying that yeah uh wealthy Europeans will come and buy your land will take your land from you uh movans will go to the EU more freely and uh the pro European government will bring in their state immigrants from Middle East and they will settle in your houses uh or LGBT anti-lgbtq propaganda and hate speech a lot of it so uh they they they found some uh sensitive topics and they pushed and pushed and pushed in a really small amount of time the voters in Moldova were bombarded with this messages okay these messages were being spread not by the by Moscow directly they were being spread by local politicians by Doon by that's the leader of Socialist Party uh and the main beer the main supporter of the um Alexander Stan who came in second in the elections and and a number of other candidates they are going from Village to Village from town to town and talking to people and spreading this narrative so so so I guess that this is one of the explanations and what the government did they said Russia Russia Russia Russia they are medling they are buying they are doing this and they are doing that but they had to campaign they had to Simply campaign they which they didn't we didn't see it that much they said Russia is buying you it's sort of offensive in a way also right yeah I mean they are buying you you are you are just selling your future your future of your kids I mean this is not how you win elections it's your people you have to talk to these people and bring it on your side if you want to win that makes a lot of sense um obviously it's for for someone that is convinced that apparently voting no is the way to go forward just calling them being bought will probably not convince them to go the other way right so yeah to me that makes perfect sense um maybe moving a bit uh moving on a bit from this topic there's a user in the chat that seems to be um maybe a bit I want to say um confused or unsure about how the relationship within mova and transnistria worked during this election because uh Lucas KERO asks why is trans nria voting if they are not under quote unquote movan control and how are they how are there more people voting yes in transnistria than other parts of mova like the part you already mentioned in the South two questions in one yeah um in transnistria they are not vote I mean movan government doesn't control the territory it doesn't open polling station there they do not campaign movan political parties and politicians they do not campaign in transnistria it's a breakaway region controlled by Russia Russia has a military base over there it's a piece of Soviet Union uh What uh the government of Moldova does they are opening the polling stations on the border okay uh for movan Citizens residing in transnistria there are a lot of more than the numbers differ but many many many people in transnistria they got movan citizenship they had the right to I mean they were born in mova before the the the the separation of of this region in the 1990s so so the movan citizens they have the right to vote and movan government opened these poing stations along the border so this is how it works okay uh as of why people voted I don't know I I I didn't check the results in those stations but I think I'm sharing it on the screen right now I believe you can see the screen as well right that I'm sharing um yes yeah is is this is this I I I don't speak M or this is so this is 31 percent yes to the the region that you mentioned gagaa was only a 5% so um I I believe at least to my knowledge trans the campaign was strong from party okay and from the opponents and and the gagaa is the place where they say sure both votes uh back in the local elections of 2022 and they use the same T same T same tactic now um but not from from transnistria I guess um no yes like it's I think it might be a bit surprising because transnistria is seen at least once again from from an out's perspective as the region that is heavily heavily almost reliant on um its relation with Russia so you would almost expect that to be the region with the most no votes but apparently that was kagia but yeah because of the reasons that you told us already yeah when you look in terms of real numbers the difference is not that big but in terms of percent percentage yes true it's a good point Thank you actually I didn't see it but uh yeah it's a good tip actually to look into it more yeah and it's a very good point yeah yeah very interesting um I want to also cover a bit of the presidential election as well right because um that was the referendum wasn't the only thing that was being voted on um for the past day days um we have of course the um three players that we that you already mentioned in some of your answers Sandu um Maya Sandu or Sandu Maya I don't know which one the first name is Maya Maya okay Maya sand um and the uh the second biggest Alexander Stan nongo rough names thank you but if I if we already discussed it a bit but if I can understand correctly there will be a second round in two weeks where these two will run off um as the as the only option so I know it is incredibly difficult to look in your proverbial crystal ball and predict the future but I and I believe the viewers as well are very interested in um seeing like what what are the what are the scenarios here um is is is Maya suu um like going or well it's difficult to say going to win but I mean with 42% of the vote already it looks like she's probably the favorite um but I was curious if you could say anything about what happens if um Alex Thunder so Nolo um gets the victory or if Maya secures the term anyways especially with relations Europe yeah her margins are really thin uh everybody below Maya Sandu was campaigning against Maya Sandu okay uh they are not campaigning against each other but everybody against her if you go down the list to the bottom you can see two candidates um Nastasia the s from the bottom and then the one above himavan so they have 1% and the and then there is the last guy ulanowski Tudor so all together they have like 2% the voters of these candidates may go to Maya Sando only voters of these candidates but the big question is uh um is the third place the king maker right on the third place what is he going to do he was in the same situation in 2020 in 2020 Maya sand was running against uh the candidate of the Socialists Igor Doon not Alexander Stog but this is the same party the same the same politicians and and was was yeah wasati wasn't on the thir uh in in 20 20 on on the third place he didn't tell his voters what to do he said just do whatever you think it's okay with you and some voted for Maya Sandu some voted for Doon Maya Sandu won in the second round in the runoff in 2020 because of huge support that he received in diaspora so okay what uh we see from this results is that Maya Sandu has made two more percentage points from mova if she doesn't negotiate anything with the third candidate on the third place with wasap which she will I don't think she will negotiate I mean she's not negotiating with she's not that kind of politician uh but the only chance for her to win is to fire up her base first of all outside mova uh people uh came to vote in diaspora in big numbers but not in the biggest numbers in 2020 more people uh came to vote in diaspora and they voted more massively for her so this is her what her strategy needs to be to win to fire up the base in diaspora to go campaign diaspora is angry um because they promised more things to Diaspora like uh inviting people back giving them jobs uh making easier for them to return because a lot of people from diaspora they are just working uh a lot and they would like to come back home so they were promised changes so that they they can return to a more prosperous country and it's it's easy for them and their expertise will be needed in the government and elsewhere and this happen so we'll see how myand will be able you know to convince these voters uh one uh the second on the before the runoff this is the only chance for her so to so to summarize real quick for the viewers um you see these these parties um the O Octavian Andre these are these are the the like the voters for them are most likely to go to um Maya okay there was a there's a question in a chat from a user called Villa um he asks can you ask him with voters of um uhon let's see I saw him just here Kiku um where they were going because he is of the or or they are of the opinion that the part his party is a pro-european party um Kik was ca he says he's Pro kind of uh we have to negotiate with the EU but it's bizarre because you cannot really negotiate with the EU different conditions than from other countries uh but uh maybe it can happen that some voters will go but Yan Kiku is is is um is talking a lot against my Sando I don't I mean he's Pro EU but he's against Mya Sandu they by the way or colleagues in in the University uh she was President he was prime minister they didn't get along he talking yeah no I don't see many of his voters voting for her I see so they have have bit of a a history together so to speak yeah already okay all right so um so the margin here is that well let's say if we're generous we have and we're talking about about sure buying votes and if this happened uh these people voted for Fortuna Victoria you see the the and and and they voted for V yeah these are if the the movan voters were paid to vote for anybody this uh their votes went to to these two candidates and maybe a little bit to stand of as well and if um is the reason for that that there are most um for the let's say neutral platform or more pro- Russia or no these are candidates controlled by Yan Shore The Fugitive oligarch I see okay okay yeah it can happen that they told he told his supporters just vote for these two candidates and then in the second round there will be a negotiation and I suspect that all of them will vote for stano so almost how much 9% of vote Plus for yeah so let's let's go into the the what that would mean for mova because um first of all like first let's talk about in the case of that Maya Sanu does manage to win the second round does that mean basically more of what we've already seen um is that positive is that negative will that accelerate EU accession um could you say anything about only positive yeah the only mova is a parliamentary Republic y the president has a mostly ceremonial role yeah except when the President also is um the founder of a of the main party right that holds the absolute majority in the parliament when she is a Founder she can control informally the policies of the government but uh and this is the case with with Maya Sandu in mova uh parliamentary elections are are expected this next summer y so if Maya wins Maya Sandu wins the second round uh and stays as President we can expect that her party will also win maybe not such a big majority as they have now but will have a good result in the summer if she Lo and that's important that's the most important thing if she loses then the European integration will be slow down if stano wins then the Socialist Party will be in a position to win the Parliamentary elections next summer and that means that Russia will have a friendly government behind Ukraine's lines okay and the European integration will be told for okay for many years all right um there's a few there's a few people in the chat they have just been joining us so I want to have a quick recap um RJ ask I just got here can I get a quick recap please and uh C cyan kov is asking what are they voting for guys we are talking about the um presidential elections in Moldova and the EU referendum that happened um currently we're talking about the specifics on um what will happen in the second the second round runoff because that will happen between the top two candidates that you see on the screen here um what that might mean for the relationship to the European Union and the prospects of EU um assession so um hopefully that's made a little bit clearer by the way guys we are almost we're we're nearing the end of the live stream so if you have any burning questions please make sure to ask them in the chat make sure to tag us so that we can see it easily and if you really want your question to be answered um which there is no guarantee of unfortunately um please use the Super Chat function so that um you not only support us uh and our work but um you will get something in return which is your burning question answered anyways um okay so having said all that um Maya Sandu will probably then in in in the next parliamentary elections have a pretty good majority um in in in Parliament if if if I'm Rec now yeah or in two weeks I mean of course um is there a scenario a user in our chat asks um is there a scenario where the a pro-russian party so I guess the closest to that would be Alexander stano's party if he wins now is there still a chance or is there still a scenario where mdova can join the EU yes um remember mova declared EU as its main foreign policy objective during the the rule of the Communist Party led by former President Vladimir vonin he came to power promising to take mova into the Russia bellarus Union and he ended up declaring European integration as his main foreign policy goal because Russia wanted to solve the transnistrian conflict in such a way that people from transnistria will be brought in kisho and control and have a big say in how the entire country is ruled so vonin said no and turned to the EU and they started implementing you know close policies with the EU um there is a scenario that if the Socialists win the elections next summer uh there is a scenario in which the European integration will proceed but in much slower Pace maybe you will get tired voters in the EU will ask why do we need mova if they don't want us so there is a scenario but the chances are really not yeah good not good okay well I I guess in that case having a I guess a majority in the referendum does help with the maybe legitimacy or perceived legitimacy at least of joining the European Union so it would be um I mean that combined with I believe our our our last guest told us that he said it today but he said that even though he does not support the referendum in fact I think he boycotted it um he does support or see a European or a movan European future um is that a is that a statement that you've you're familiar with or yeah some voters they say that the referendum right now was a way for Maya Sandu to campaign for herself and get more votes in presidential elections and some people didn't didn't support the referendum anyways um I think that the different the the the the the results being so close mova will have to do another referendum if she mova negotiates with the EU before for joining mhm there are there are maybe I this I say this lightly um without much conviction but some people see a scenario and this is far in the future so I know any of the predictions or thoughts are uh with a grain of salt let's say that that because this election or this um referendum was so close some fear that if mdova were to um come into the European Union you would have a similar state or a similar um member to Hungary that is um as you might know famous famous for blocking many of the EU legislation um many some are afraid of another EU EU skeptic member state that is going to um help or well help against let's ackowledge the elephant in the room right the war in Ukraine if Russia wins there I mean everything changes completely uh we not okay be talking about by Hungary in Moldova we'll be talking about I don't know completely different things yeah yeah of course let's keep in mind that if Ukraine still holds that's one thing if it doesn't then okay all that we spoke about tonight is is not that no okay okay yeah no understood I um it's it's it's very interesting and of course it makes sense I I I hadn't really considered it but it's a very good point to to take into account that of course what happens in Ukraine will affect this region probably one of the most inside of Europe um okay well I think we are nearing the end of our time so I want to invite you to say anything say any last words any wishes any any thoughts please go ahead the floor is yours well thank thank you for inviting me I hope your audience enjoyed the discussion and uh I I'm surprised that people are still curious about what's going on in mova no there's there's definitely a lot of people interested um there were
