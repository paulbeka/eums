    "transcription": "you ready yep we're live happy days we are live good evening everyone you are very welcome to the EU Made Simple live my name is Leon jop I'm an author podcaster and nonprofit leader based out of Ireland I'm here today with the uh brains behind the EU Made Simple account lamberto Robin lambertus how are you I am very well I'm very well I'm super excited to talk about these results honestly and thank you very much for the opportunity to talk to us of course ab and um yeah exactly super so look let's get into it we're we're currently in Brussels we're in the EU Parliament it's been uh crazy today in here so tell us a little bit about what you've been seeing today yeah so exactly the EU simple has been invited to the uh European Parliament so uh and um basically because of all of you online right now because you're watching my content so firstly thank you for that and we followed the elections tonight right in the main on the main stage yeah and uh I mean it's been amazing it's been so much media there I was sitting next to Ard and F they're like big media channels from Germany yeah and uh pretty much trying to create content and um showing everyone's happening over here super so look uh let's let's jump straight into the the political discourse then so can you give us a quick overview of what's been happening today on on the ground in the elections right I mean right off the bat macron called a general election it's it's insane I mean and we'll get into it today tonight but honestly I'm still trying to scrap my own brain why he did that like everyone knew Le Pen was going to win by quite a big margin so he must have prepared it he knew he was going to call this tonight and I can't wait I'm going to tell everyone my thoughts about it of why he did it uh but that's the the bombshell absolute bombshell and um maybe I'll continue very quickly I mean it's kind of expected the far right or the right wing let's put it that way some call it far right um grew tonight yeah massively massively and especially Germany I want to get into later they grew a lot more than more than I thought actually okay I was going to ask you what what what has been a surprise for you in this uh election well a surprise um honestly I don't know I had have thought that IFD that's the German right-wing party I already thought with the scandals they had that they would actually lose like I don't know not lose but go behind greens and SPD I thought that could happen but the surprise was that the you have to imagine the ruling Coalition in Germany the greens the SPD and the um what I forget the FTP of course they only got I think 31% of the vote right and that's insane because they're they got 50% in the national elections so they absolutely went down and have DEC capitalized super okay so from from let's let's maybe take it from European perspective first who has been the biggest winner and who has been the biggest loser I mean we're St on line we'll be happy won't you I mean I mean everyone here you can see the screen so let me you know maybe I'll scroll down a bit but this is the parliament um currently the polls well not the polls the actual exit polls yeah of how it will look like and you can see the first one is the EP so they gained 10 seats which is the big party with Ora underline at the helm so I think they're big Winners but and this is crucial right if you scroll down another massive winner um is well identity and democracy group if you ask me uh why because they gained 11 seats right and that is without having the afd part of that because the afd was kicked out last week that's right so they gained 11 seats even though the afd was kicked out so yeah yeah go ahead sorry go no absolutely and that's that's I I wanted to talk about those because we're we're seeing um you know more Independence coming in um not not uh included uh be being there could you tell us a little bit about what that means um for for this election and what those groupings are uh the the European groups you mean yes please yeah I mean I think a lot of the viewers here know it already but very quickly how it works is you have National parties in every country and they come together to form a European group and there's actually another layer above it or between it which is a European party but let's not get into the difficulties there and so for example the EP you have the uh CDU from Germany you have the PPP from or PP from Spain yeah and you have fors Italia from Italy and not not hundreds but like 50 other parties sure yeah and then they're not included um that group what why are they there who are they which not included group so it's ni or I or whichever one so maybe the furest right I believe yeah maybe for the audience this is also super interesting I'm happy you you pointed on it right because look non-attached members are basically parties or MEPS within parties that are not part of a group right uh why because either the groups don't want to work with them or they can't find a group that fits their I don't know their ideology or whatever right and look how much it went up we had 62 um in the previous Parliament and now we have 100 so that means we have 38 addition Ms who have not been Affiliated to a group sure now one of this I already explained is the afd that's I think or help me out in the comments but I think it's what 18 MEPS 18 oh that might be completely wrong but quite a few MEPS right um and um and of course another one is Orban Victor Orban he's also not affiliated I mean you can guess why he's uh he's not well liked many parties um but he could fit with the indd maybe or the ECR we'll see so no it's a very exciting time and um there's a lot to play for yeah now I I I hate to speculate but I see you as someone who has a lot of knowledge in this area so I would love to pick your brains on it was actually when we uh met in Strasburg that you you taught me a lot about the European Parliament and the commission um and stuff like that so I think you would know a lot about what potential parties could merge split off break off I'd love to you know pick your brain on who you think might go where is there any um par that might marriage or split I would love to I would okay I'm going to speculate massively now right so everyone pinch your soul and um put your ideas in the in the in the comments if you have some different ideas than I do yeah but my speculation is is the big speculation is ECR and I right because those are the right-wing parties in the parliament or the even far right parties in the parliament so they are talking about let's create a super well they some of them they want to create a super group right this will be ECR and IND together right um that's some of the speculation um the chances of that happening from an eade simple perspective for me is no more than what 10 20% maybe okay because they differ very much um between their stance and Russia the indd is very Pro not pro Russia it's too strong but wants to build relations right the ECR is very anti-russia so they're very Pro Ukraine so you think that that could that might be a blocker it might be it's a massive blocker right but if of course the indd or parties within the indd could jump to the ECR you never know that could happen some of the more milder ones maybe um but at the same time there could be some ECR parties that might be interested in joining the ep the the big one right sure and there's like a love triangle it's literally a love triangle between meloney money I don't want to get these right so money Leen and Ola ferline right because Ola ferline wants to work with both and Leen wants to work with Maloney and Maloney can choose which one she wants yeah a proper love triangle yeah right okay superb so we we we've heard from some of the the lead commission candidates today you you reckon or on line is is the most content at the moment I I love this topic so uh also love speculation about this um for the audience very quickly the way it works is that when the elections are over um basically well they're over tonight so tomorrow what we'll start is the European Council which are basically the 27 heads of state will get together and they're going to discuss who will be the next commission president and I think Ora f l is pretty much a shoe in there I really think I see like a 70% chance you don't see any curve balls coming out of the woodwor but the parliament is the issue right because the second step of becoming commission president is the parliament has to agree with you okay what does that mean there's a vote in the European Parliament so let me start from the start European Council says Orsa you go and then Ursa goes to the Parliament and says you please vote for me the parliament votes and she has to get an absolute majority which means more than half the parliament has to agree and you can have a bit of fun actually maybe we can play around with the numbers a little bit so hang hang with me uh C here so here for example this is the parliament right right and here's the EP here is the snd right and here is renew Europe right these are the ones that work together in the last Parliament and as you can see they have 401 seats so that's majority of 30 so really Le not Leen Ora thunderline could win with that right the problem is she has rebels in her own party uh so again uh the plot thickens the plot thickens and I mean sorry I can you have to stop me if it's too much detail but I love this topic because um in the EP there's also the French Republicans and they don't like orsela and even the CDU in Germany there is some detractors I wouldn't call them traitors but you know they're they're gonna vote against her sure and um and you never know right oh of course the snd they they're all not fans of her either so she doesn't if you ask me she does not have the votes in these three parties so what is she been doing she's been flirting here I've clicked it now the ECR right because I think she's kind of begging on Maloney to support her but the problem is it's like a two-edged sword right because if Maloney then just supports her and look yeah underline flirts with the ECR then the snd and the renew Europe will be like no thanks and we'll take their support away so she is she's in such difficult Waters Leon yeah no this this is a you know a political uh place that you don't necessarily want to find House of Cards man house the cards it's exciting so far I love it I love it it'sing it's I'm sure to make a Netflix series on it well yeah and okay so before before we get into now um like kind of France in a little bit more detail I want to talk about the turnout um right 51% is that a surprise what are your thoughts on that I am ecstatic it's more than five years ago I mean I'm not going to hide my bias here I am I I like the EU I think there's a lot to improve but I think it's an important Institution for us um and I'm very happy more people voted either rightwing left wing middle it it doesn't matter to me in that sense people should vote the main thing is that people went down they exercised their right 100% honestly yeah yeah no that's that's that's that's brilliant but but sorry Leon I have to interrupt you it's not enough okay yeah I mean I am from the Netherlands everyone here they just know I'm from the Netherlands and um our voting turned out for a national election 70% or like 7 4 I think right again correct me in the comments if I'm I'm wrong yeah but the European elections were 48% and that's that's insane yeah no and that's like you know while while it is up in in in most countries now overall across Europe it's it's it's up we've seen some countries like Croatia with you know nearly a 10% deficit H Greece with nearly a 20% deficit in and turn out why do you think things like that are are happening oh it's a good question it's a very very good question I know it's hard for me to talk about Greece because I don't live there um I know that the Dutch um I know that the the the right-wing Dutch people or the more right-wing they they feel a bit disenfranchised by the EU or they don't really have a relationship with the EU right so a lot of them didn't turn out to vote and this is also one of the reason why reasons why Builders the pbv party did well sure but didn't do as well as many expected because his base didn't turn up okay so I think it's to answer your question I think it's a feeling of not feeling the connection to it like what does the EU do for me yeah right and this is something many people don't see and how do we improve that I know sorry I know we're getting into a little bit off the elections but I think you're someone who has uh you extent of knowledge of the area so if if you don't mind sure go into that for a minute or two sure how are we going to make things better how are we goingon to make things better you've been turn out yes oh man it's a good question it's a good question no I think maybe maybe more so yeah turnout but maybe overall communication between the EU and it's you know what Leon I'm gonna do I am going to take full credit for the extra 1% that is all the channel so anyone e made simple did it congratulations no that's that'se it's jokes of course it's jokes but um honestly the reason I started the channel is exactly what you just said yeah because um people don't really I think the first step is to make people understand what the EU is what it does um why it's relevant and I think once they see that they're more inclined to vote and that is why I started it so um and and initially you know my videos were watched by my mom my dad you know my sister right um and then you know they they grew and people got interested and um and I think that's the first step I think it's education sadly but not sadly I think that's what it is yeah absolutely no I think education is key not not not just in in uh like voting but also across many different social issues yeah okay let's jump into some of the juicy stuff you're going into the countries now right yeah we're going into we're going into we're back into France yeah yeah and also maybe if I just interrupt you I I see so many people online I'm loving this so if you do have questions um definitely put them in the chat but try to make them relevant about what we talk about I mean I'm kind of taking away your job here as a I'm trying now you may have noticed that I wear glasses terrible eyesight I can't actually see the chat yeah but I'll see if any of the mods can send me the questions directly and I'll try and read them out in a couple of moments yeah and if you see any great questions that pop up definitely just read and answer them okay super so mcon dissolves Parliament man okay this is this is crazy and to be honest I would love the the the audience to also have a have their opinion but I just open on the screen I know you difficult for you to see but here this is what happened in France so France has 81 seats yeah right and 31 went 31 went to um the national rally that's sens party right so she won let's face by Landslide 31% second place is 15% okay yeah so she she killed it so she's over double the the next she did she did I mean congratulations to her I have to say she did very well um not just her I mean her um bordon I think his name is is um God having a blank right now but um he she has a she didn't lead the campaign it was one of her one of the people in her party right and um yeah they did very very well but and this is the big butt it was expected yeah like all the polls showed it so it wasn't a surprise and it wasn't a surprise that they won or it wasn't a surprise that they won by so much to be honest with you it was a couple more percent than I thought it would be but it wasn't like plus minus 3% maybe you know so so yeah I saw it as like wow that's more than I thought but it was expected what was unexpected was literally macron announcing what like half an hour after the results yeah we're gonna have a general general election that's huge it's massive what are the implications so again for the audience very quickly macron is the second here um he's he works with renew so renew is his affiliation and as you can see it's a coalition too it's not just macron party it's a whole Coalition of different parties and they only got 15% so that's obviously a fail a failure especially because the Socialists below it with 14% they are obviously um almost beat him anyway so okay what are the implications and now speculation right and I really think um what he's trying to do is he's calling the election so this is a parliament election it's very important it's not a presidential election so this means that uh the Parliament and the Prime Minister will be elected right the end of the month right and that means it could be well I speculate National rally will win national rally will have a prime minister that they're in favor of so to speak I mean macron still has a big hand to play with the Prime Minister but I can't see it any other way I only see macron losing it yeah and I think the speculate what I speculate is that okay let her govern so to speak the legislative branch of of France for two years until the general election and hopefully sorry not the general election until the president election and hopefully in his eyes hopefully she well screwed up so much or messes up or whatever he hopes it is maybe with him helping her mess up yeah this is pure speculation right I want to put question then and then maybe just to finish my thought and then when it is the presidential election that she won't win okay that's and again please in the comments I that's the best I can do I was I wanted to ask you know um from looking from the outside in it's it's difficult see a path forward from is is mcon finished yeah I mean I mean let's be honest right the French normally don't really elect a president for a second term right I mean if you look at Anand the one before that uh sarosi I think also but normally anyway it's one term because the French they're um I don't make generalizations but they do generally uh get tired with politicians quite quickly right right so it was already um impressive if you ask me that you won a second term but then he pushed through certain reforms that really annoyed the French be it for example the pension reform that um lowering their pension age that really annoyed a lot of people yeah um so is he finished on in France yeah in two years he's done right yeah I mean he can't get re-elected anyway it's 10 years is up yeah right I just I just think you think he'll make it to those two the end of those two years yeah I think so yeah okay yeah yeah he'll remain president yeah right super yeah so I supposed to uh maybe draw draw some some conclusions what what is what is next next what can people expect to see over the next couple of weeks let's hold that question I quite like what this guy he's doing here uptick up he tagged us as you can see EU Made Simple so that's easy way to read the questions sweet he asked one question so I kind of want to get involved with that is there any chance of afd joining the indd oh no I don't think so um removing the afd from the indd group just to quickly answer that question um was a PR stunt for the pen if you ask me right um I know it's not your question so back to yeah so it's a PR stunt because I do think that there's differences between the parties 100% but I do think Leen um can use that locally to say look we're not extremists um and and to be fair she has moved a lot more to the center so so I think that's why she used kicking out the afd and now taking them back in after the election makes no sense to me right okay but there could be a new new group that forms so that's the answer and and that's it yeah you know that that's what we could see is is that new new group uh forming so yeah sorry what was your question my question was you know what can people expect to see from your followers over the next couple of weeks the EU yeah I mean what they can see is um we'll be uh we'll be publishing a lot of content in the next couple of weeks on the election results and the fun thing is it really doesn't stop here it starts yeah because yeah we have the parliament but as po most people probably know uh we have two other institutions right most of all the European commission and we have to have 20 27 Commissioners elected we need to have the president elected and there's no better Channel on YouTube to cover that L Made Simple 100% yeah and we have a French EU Made Simple too we have a German EU simple so anyone online who wants a different language and you or maybe you're tired of my voice you can definitely do that absolutely lots of questions coming in we do have lots of questions coming in go ahead you can you can fire away yeah I feel kind of bad because you're like moderating it I'm just enjoying watching you work all right all right okay okay this is yeah here's another interesting one are druggies chances totally over so drugie you have you heard of drugie I haven't heard of ah he's a drugie in Ireland is something it's someone who imagine I could imagine um actually I made a video on this so I made a video saying the five most likely candidates to kick Ursa thunderline off her pedestal right okay and my number two was drugging and he is basically a previous Italian politician he was the president of the central bank if I'm not mistaken and was prime minister in Italy I think yeah yeah exactly so anyway he has a lot big political career and there's speculation that he might take over as um the commission President right um and that's why I think he asked the question his big downside if you ask me he's a technocrat which everyone would say that's positive but it's not when you have the EP as the biggest party okay because they want someone from their own ranks why would they settle for a technocrat that's my biggest downside with him and macron played around with the name drugie and macron is severely weakened or at least you know what I mean yeah difficult difficult so I don't again honestly anything can happen but yeah that's the answer to that question okay we're seeing tons of questions coming yeah we seeing lots of questions should we here's another question about the Netherlands should we have a look at Netherlands go ahead let's go yeah so the Netherlands because someone is asking about that and we should probably look at Germany too if you want to any yeah more happy to do so Netherlands so here we go everyone the Netherlands right any questions in the Netherlands you were the first on to vote we were what was the overall turnout there I actually voted in the Netherlands yeah I'm not gonna say who I voted for of course but that would kill my uh anyway um what happened so the Netherlands very quickly um there is the pvv right they are the right-wing farri party in um in in the Netherlands and the crazy thing or the interesting thing is that he cleaned up the national election like literally took it out of the park very unexpected um so everyone was thinking in this election now he's going to clean it up but he didn't he did very well don't take anything away from him but he didn't win it was actually the uh the uh the greens together with the um God I'm having a blank right now pvda is called it's like a labor party but and the funny thing is now if you look here it actually looks like the indd one um so the pvv because the greens and the pvda they work together in a coalition but when they come to the European Parliament they split up so in a way you could actually say that he did win her Fiers right okay yeah in terms of the single yeah yeah exactly yeah I mean I I think Builders um could have done a lot better if his if his base came to vote and it's honestly it's a shame they didn't like the European elections are so important and I wish everyone goes to vote yeah and now tell me in in in terms of like euroskepticism is is he like the guy for oh yeah he's very Euros skeptic he's very Euros skeptic I mean before in the national elections his Manifesto he had a page saying we need a next hit referendum right that kind of Euros skepticism yeah yeah we've had that in Ireland as well we've had our our exit which doesn't sound as cool as breit or an exit um but yeah it doesn't seem to have taken off I mean um we we have a growing kind of farri presence in Ireland but nothing actually sorry to R let's let's look at Ireland let's look at Ireland yeah yeah I don't think they're not out yet I know cuz one of one of our one of our cents is closed because there was a football match on brilliant so yeah in Ireland we're a little bit more uh you know we'll take our time kind of thing yeah you're taking your time but ultimately you know what we saw nearly was a little bit more of the same our uh greens are looking actually in a lot of danger at the moment we've a couple there um who are on the verge of losing their seats um we've won kind of far right right in but like a more kind of right H sided instigator coming in who wants to embarrass the government it looks like he might win a seat um that's that's kind of the main shocks you know like in Ireland we've only ever had two parties ever in government F fall and Fina girl um they're both kind of Center left center right it's only ever switched between the two of those can I throw a curve ball at you of course Irish reunification oh wow I know I'm killing it sorry I mean very we smoke about now I was probably a little bit uh you know more merry um after after after dinner but um yeah okay very quickly maybe just very briefly because you're Irish why I'm taking the chance I'm taking okay fine fine fine I'll answer yeah I think it's possible in my lifetime what will need to happen is a border pole which is a referendum on both sides of the island in Northern Ireland and in the Republic um I think there's a lot of Pros there in that there's a lot of uh kind of sentiment a lot of kind of people just feeling nostalgic about an Ireland that could be you know even though nostalg is in pass whatever but yeah um on the other side though we have kind of economic uh barriers as questions over our national Ana and what that might look like um the reason why Northern Ireland has remained separate from Ireland is because uh the the majority in Northern Ireland for so long has been uh Protestant and Loyalist and wanting to remain right in the UK that changed last year right um and and has been reflected in in uh so religion is becoming a lesser thing too yeah yeah I think so you know as immigration uh happens as well there's people that are coming in to the country and saying well actually I'd probably be better off in the EU you know so that's that's something that um we need to considering this yeah actually the funny thing is and I'm going to advertise the channel a little bit now we have a video coming on um on uh we're creating it right now about uh when labor comes into power in the UK I know this is not Ireland but still um about them getting closer to the EU is it possible and stuff like that so subscribe friends if you want to see I met Jeremy Corbin recently did you yeah and uh he was a great guy he gave Takis pen and but look that's that's socialism for right right so so I'm just looking at the question of course absolutely so let's take another question from the group is that okay yeah all right okay let's have a look there's loads but let's choose one not Netherlands something else um what about Orban how does it look like for him would could he replace afd andd is is Hungary results out already I don't think so right should we have a look at Hungarian results let's go no sadly no no um that's a question to park I mean very quickly could he join the indd I mean oh if I remember my knowledge correctly he used to be in the EP Orban with his fides party I think so and he got kicked out back then and he's been in nonin inren basically not affiliated for for a couple of years um could he rejoin could he join indd yeah maybe that could I mean I could see that happening um or maybe the ECR although I don't see that happening because orbon is you know bing bing together with with Putin and the ECR is definitely not in favor of Putin so yes the indd yes ECR no I don't see ECR super yeah um right well I'm not I'm not sure how long we have left I think we have time for a couple more questions yeah we've got a couple exactly um what's Malone let's have a look what are the odds of EP going rightwing Coalition ECR plus Ed uh zero sorry I mean I'm GNA be honest zero because here it's a good question I I don't want to make uh you know here let's have a look if EP right so everyone in the on the call the AP is 186 seats um and needs 175 more for majority so then let's take the conservative and reformists based on current polls and let's take the indd so as you can see 45 more seats are needed for a majority right right so I don't see them uh uh going for a um do you see them Co R and it makes most sense I mean look look at this right it's that gives them a majority right right I I think the reason why thunderline is flirting with the ECR is because she needs the votes from the from the from the parliament get her into Power she's concerns that there there will be Rebels from the stre I entertained the idea today again pure speculation imagine Maloney leaving the ECR and joining the EP yeah it won't happen I don't think because um today actually we had this discussion in the parliament I was actually about to say that over the course we've we've met twice now um and in Strasburg you were speaking with John Duke who spokesperson of of the EU and then today we were speaking with philu Philip schumeister who's the one of the heads of unit for for the director general of communications you've asked questions on both occasions yeah um how do you think they've they've handled it um how do you think the the communication has has been from the parliament to us yes I think it's been it's it's great so just everyone knows we've been invited here right we've had great speakers they've been very amazing accommodating us and I think it's so important I think content creators like yourself like myself and all of the others that were here they have a following right I mean look how cool we have about 1500 people in the call that's incredible that's amazing I mean thank you everyone for for listening to us and making European politics you know fun yeah yeah so I think they've done very well with that I do I would like to see a bit more from the Parliament and from the EU in terms of advertising the EU across across Europe a bit more I mean there is there is money here there is smart smart heads and stuff and there was a very good point from someone today who said when I looked at the Croatian media you know like the main media channels the EU elections were number one yeah why yeah why like the European Parliament takes some money in your hand and put a sponsored ad or whatever absolutely on these on these on these websites I just don't understand like these are the it's crazy when to think about that when you see the level of Journalism here there's over a thousand journalists here with journalists from Japan ser I the UK like it's it's it's the biggest press conference in the world right now happening right here right right sorry just see yeah yeah you're right you're completely right and that's uh yeah and um oh by the way just a very quick interlude um we uh we have 1,500 people 500 people on the call I think you're all Watchers of the channel and I want to take the opportunity to sign up to our patreon if you like this kind of content because honestly like to put it really clearly you do keep us going we're not sponsored by the EU yes we got this invitation but we're definitely not paid by them um so your support helps a lot so thank you very much but anyway um let's look at do you have a couple time for no yeah of course I I'll I'll we until 2 am I mean if I mean we still if you want to do on our five to 10 minutes if you want because we have so many people more than happy to do so yeah absolutely then let's let's take a look at a at at another question um okay here what is your opinion on the third largest group being non- insr in I can never say that world inits okay how do you think this group will impact other groups as parties chose affiliation false vacuum thank you for the question so let's take a look at the non inits which are them wow big huh very big group 100 wow it's like what 15% MH yeah what's your opinion I mean like it's worrying like you know I mean like I'm a I'm a mix race man um if if they're coming in with uh you know radical ideologies of um like a white Europe or whatever then yeah I'm I'm concerned you know and and a lot of the people that I work for would be concerned as well about what the the the people not aligned you mean yeah not align if if they are coming from a background that is like very very far right you know and it's like a a kind of ethn nationalist point of view of course they could they could be in any right um they could be in any party at the moment but yeah for me I'm I'm I'm a little bit worried about the the US trending towards the right about the rise of uh you know racism that we're seeing across Europe right um that that that concerns me so I'd like to see a little bit more detail in terms of where these people are going yeah yeah I understand so I mean in the in the 100 um seats by the way just for the uh people in the audience there's there's a lot of parties in there right there's the afd who's been kicked out of the IND and they definitely have I mean again not been proven yet but they have connections to dubious actors in China in you know in Russia and they definitely do have strings of in their party I don't want to generalize the whole party of what you said like you know a bit yeah yeah and then there's there's others like Orban who's got the connection with uh yeah with with Putin of course so anyway just to answer the question from the person on the call it's too big but I think that will change I think over the next couple weeks and that's another reason to to look for our videos this this 100 will get a lot smaller because they're going to find new coalitions now that's what's that's what will happen for that question there might be people that are willing to shift or make concessions on some of their policies to join up with some of the pares yeah yeah sure exactly sorry I'm just looking at questions and there's a very valid question here can you please have a look at Eastern Europe so this is Chevalier we have not talked about Eastern Europe at all so let's look at One More Country and then we'll do closing uh yeah so Eastern Europe um let's have a look at Romania maybe they're not are they in they were in yeah earlier on uh one have a look let's the first one I mean let's let's look at Romania and Poland I mean Poland's also I think also central eastern I don't want to be like bad let's have a look at Poland because this is very interesting too sure so the winner in Poland is here with 38% it's um the platforma obesa right so um this is the Tusk party do you know do you know Tusk donus Donal Tusk exactly yeah so they did very very well I'm I'm quite impressed um how they did because I thought peace might do a little comeback um but they're both have 19 seats so they both have quite a lot of seats sure um yeah so good news for the EP and very good news for the ECR to both big winners here um and then of course here oh I forgot that there's another EP Coalition there so I mean party so yeah so I mean I don't know what else to say it's it's I think it's kind of expected these results I think the Tusk is a little bit higher than I thought it would but it's kind of expected okay good and then over to ROM Romania so here ah the um god I didn't even check these results yet the social the partio social Democrats so the social party got the most seats with 54% so this is very good for the snd I really wish I could see here how many they won because here I don't know how how they did last time okay you know I think if you scroll up there might be the 20 uh 19 to 2024 yeah numbers maybe in the other the other website yeah check here the European one yeah let's check this very quickly uh Romania that's 2024 to 20 29 that's the right one yeah so here we have the estimates here went up we can see here right ah yeah here we can see no we can't if you scroll back is this the does Theon parament and this is the incoming one so there's the yeah 2020 2019 to 20 24 is on this and then and this is the new one ah okay God I'm being very you're right I'm being very silly so that's still National and that's the European Parliament so if I can maybe I can here I think I figured it out sorry everyone here if I do this here we go so now we have the the old government and then we have the new one so Romania the EP actually no the snd grew massively okay wow the social social side grew and the EP um fell so it's against European results yeah yeah
