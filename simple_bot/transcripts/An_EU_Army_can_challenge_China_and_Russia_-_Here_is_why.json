    "transcription": "2.1 trillion dollars that was the total global military spend in 2021 and if you have a look at the last 20 years military spend has steadily increased to a point where today we almost spent double of what was spent in year 2000 it is quite incredible that the us alone spent more than 800 billion dollars which amounts for more than a third of all military spending worldwide china sits in second place accounting for 14 percent and india a third with 3.6 the first eu country is france in sixth place who spent 57 billion dollars accounting for 2.7 percent of military spending a fraction of what the united states or even china is responsible for however if the eu were to pool their resources together would this make a difference this video will address this question in three parts firstly how would an eu army work secondly how would an eu army compare to other world powers and we'll look at both spending and at military equipment and thirdly will an eu army be a global superpower like the states or china currently the eu member states are sovereign and determine their own laws in areas such as education taxes and defense for an eu army to work the eu would have to develop into a more federal model where some powers such as defense are centralized on an eu-wide level this means that the european commission the parliament or a new military entity would have control over the eu army and can decide when to deploy this would allow the eu to have a unified response when it comes to conflicts which is especially relevant now with putin's war in ukraine this would also address the ineffective eu battle groups which were formed in 2007 and have embarrassingly never been deployed furthermore the eu can pull together resources in terms of infrastructure military equipment intelligence and so on therefore getting more out of every euro spent now this is obviously a very complex topic and there are many hurdles towards this actually happening i am currently working on a video that will look into the types of models the eu can develop into so if you're interested in that please subscribe and hit the bell icon to be notified also there are two videos on my channel with reasons for and against an eu army if you'd like more detail next let's look at how powerful an eu army would actually be on the world stage starting with military spend here is military spend per country for 2021 with france and germany the only two eu countries in the top 10. the us and china have a bigger population so it's not that surprising to see them so far ahead but if we take the eu as a whole it actually has more people than the us so how does the eu compare a military spend let's have a look at the 27 eu countries sorted by the amount they spend on their military france germany and italy lead the pack and if we scroll through all the 27 eu countries we will find cyprus luxembourg and malta at the bottom which also makes sense as they are the smallest now if we combine all of the eu countries together this would result in 257 billion dollars this would move the eu to third place in the global spending list not too far behind china but still a long way behind the us it gets really interesting when you sort by percentage of gdp spent on military as middle eastern countries end up at the top of the list the first eu country is greece with 3.48 however if we filter on eu countries again you see that only eight of them spend over two percent and at the bottom there are actually four european countries who spent less than one percent most eu countries are also part of nato where the military spending guideline is two percent which may also be enforced for an eu army not to mention that five eu countries have already pledged to increase their defense spending to meet the two percent target set by nato so imagine if all the eu countries below the nato threshold would increase their spending to two percent firstly the top eight would look rather different with germany moving into third place now let's combine all the eu countries together again as you can see the total spending now sits at 342 billion dollars putting the eu in second place ahead of china but still significantly behind the united states now there's one element that i've left out of the analysis so far and that is purchasing power parity purchasing power parity or ppp is an economic term for measuring prices at different locations for instance one million dollars in china will get you more goods and services than one million dollars in the states for example if we look at military personnel salaries china will be able to employ more personnel for one million dollars than the us the same goes for equipment and operations this is due to differences in living standards and currency a study by vox eu linked in the description determined a ratio specific to military spending and found that china can get 1.6 times more out of their military spending than the us and for india and russia this is a whopping 3.4 and 3.2 respectively sadly the data for the eu is incomplete s vox eu has only identified ratios for germany france and italy for now let's be somewhat conservative and take france's value and apply it to all eu countries now the picture looks quite different again sure the u.s is still number one by a long way but the eu drops down to third and india and russia and south korea all break the 100 billion dollar mark obviously military spent doesn't necessarily mean military might and next we'll have a look at how the eu us and china compare a military equipment now before you roast me in the comments two quick points firstly i know this is not the best comparison and that there are many more factors when comparing military powers such as the ones mentioned here and secondly the source i'm using is global firepower maybe not the most reliable but it's the best i've found so far but let's have a look nonetheless firstly here are all the countries in the european union france is the only country with nuclear weapons and also has the biggest air force and navy with more than 1 000 aircraft one aircraft carrier 10 destroyers 11 frigates and 10 submarines it often goes unnoticed that italy also has a considerable navy with two aircraft carriers and a third likely to be commissioned this summer as for tanks poland and greece lead the pack with over 2000 tanks between them towards the bottom of the list there are malta and luxembourg who only have a couple thousand soldiers but they are also the smallest countries in the eu now let's combine all these numbers into an eu army and compare to the chinese military the numbers are quite similar with china leading an active military personnel submarines and destroyers and the eu leading in aircraft aircraft carriers and frigates however if we take the us into the picture they are still clearly ahead leading in every category except for frigates but i don't think that matters when you have that many destroyers then compared to india the eu leads in almost every category and if we take russia into the picture they clearly lead the eu in terms of tanks and nuclear weapons but less so on the sea lastly there is the uk who have an impressive military for their size but fall short in all categories when compared to an eu army now if we look at the most military numbers per category the picture looks like this so on to the last section of my video could an eu army rival the us or china in terms of military spend and current military numbers no definitely not the united states as for china the numbers are a lot closer but due to many difficulties that come with creating an integrated eu army it is unlikely to challenge china in the short term not to mention that the chinese economy is still booming when compared to the eu so when we take nuclear weapons out of the equation today's analysis would suggest that an eu army could come into third place as they spend more than russia and india and also have more military equipment however there are so many challenges that come with an eu army for example what language will be spoken and who's in charge and what about all the different types of equipment for instance europeans operate more than 11 different types of tanks imagine the enormous problems regarding maintenance supply and training and what about member state sovereignty and how will the military budget be determined and what about public support european leaders have expressed some interest but there are many hurdles to overcome more realistic is a defense union of the willing where a select number of eu nations decide to enter into a military alliance if you enjoy these types
