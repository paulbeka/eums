    "transcription": "e and I think we're live all right cool everyone um welcome again to the eom Made Simple live stream um super excited to get to go get going and we have a very cool program planned for you today I've still B upset from after the Euro the Euros that we just saw well not upset um actually quite excited because the Netherlands won which is a a big a big win because I'm from the Netherlands so um I hope you tune into that and now it's a bit strange from football going into to into politics and uh yeah anyway so I have to refocus but anyway um we have a big plan for you today so as you can see I'm sharing my screen and um we're going to look at the European Parliament so we're going to look at what the seats are currently as you can see on the left there is the European Parliament composition that we have today and on the right we're going to make some predictions so some EU Made Simple predictions of which parties that are currently non- Affiliated or which parties that are affili ated and then map them to to the big European groups so um really I want you all to get involved so I've got the comments open I can see what you're writing so if you have any comments or ideas or questions just you know go in there with that um and also the cool thing is what we have we have four guests today from different countries in Europe so we have someone from Romania we have someone from Luxembourg we have someone from Portugal that will basically also give us their ideas on what happened in their country during the elections and what happening what's happening to their unaligned uh political parties so that's a bit of the AAR that we're doing and at the very end thank you so much for mentioning it um I am C Monkey we have made 100K subscribers so we're super excited and at the end of the stream we're goingon to have a little celebration we're gonna have the whole team on the call and uh really show you who we are and and what we do so so hang in there awesome all right so what we're starting so in the left here on the screen you can see the European Parliament today so we have the European groups here as you can see just very quickly for people that don't know I mean you should if you watch my videos we have the EP it's a center right we have the snd which is a center left party political group on the European stage we have renew Europe which is the liberal center Liberal then we have the ECR they're right-wing conservative so a bit more to the right than the EP we have the indd that's the farri factions on the European level and we have the greens and and then we also have the left of course they're they're farle they are all the furthest left parties throughout throughout Europe so those are the the the the the parties on the European level and I know you've watch my videos the way it works is we have parties within the countries that align to these groups so for example the EP will have um you know CSU cuu in Germany it will have Fort Italia etc etc but if you have any questions put them into the chat anyway so what we're going to do is here below I have all the national parties they're currently non-aligned so these currently do not have a group that they're Affiliated to and as you can see there's a filter here we can also look at other um yeah political groups in their relevant parties but today we're looking at the the non we're looking at the non-aligned parties so uh and we're going to give them a group so for example the afd if we give that to the EP it's not going to happen it's a joke but if the afd were to join the EP you can see here here the predictions change so what will happen is there's an additional 15 seats to the EP that we're predicting from eums giving them 205 seats in total and based on the last week of everything that's happened there could really be some shakeups and we're going to go through all of these shakeups today um starting with the alternative through Deutschland which is the afd so um that's what we're going to start with so before we introduce our first guest we're first going to talk about the afd and I I think you know you know the afd it's a far right party in in in Germany and um they have recently been kicked out of the indd group so once again we have the indd group here and um I'm just reading a comment Andre thank you for your comment I can't wait to get to San she is the sixth on our list or fifth actually or fourth and I'll explain to you where I think she's going to go um but it's very exciting it's a very interesting new party in in Germany and exactly but going back to indd group so IFD the IFD in Germany has been kicked out of the indd for being too extreme couple things that happened you know um well first of all maximan CRA their lead candidate made some comments about not all Nazis being necessarily bad which of course did not go down well with the indd especially Le Pen who kind of used it as a PR stunt and kicked out the indd but the crazy thing is uh kicked out the afd from the indd but the crazy thing is on Wednesday this week the farri right parties they in the IND they met together and um there was talk about accepting the IFD back into the indd and the last live stream I said no way the IFD will go back to the IND but it's looking more more likely Leen said no for now but I think after the election uh I think the afd will return to the IND so I'm going to give them here to indd and let me know in the comments do you agree do you think indd will grow with the IFD or not would love to know anyway that having said we do have our first guest here today now so as you know throughout this call or throughout this live stream I'm going through all of these unaffiliated parties but for now we are going to switch to Luxembourg and we have a guest that is actually from Luxembourg his name is kristos Flores or floros he is part of the democratic party in Luxembourg and the Democratic party got a seat in the European elections I believe he ran himself and also the Democratic party is Affiliated to renew Europe um so it would be great to hear a little bit about what uh what Christos has to say about that and Christos I think you're here so it'd be great to to hear what you've got to got to say about that and ah I think he just joined Hi kristos how are you shour how are you very good did you hear my introduction about you or uh or I was watching on the live live stream with everyone else perfect perfect because I just noted I didn't accept you to the call so but now I now I accepted you uh kist it's amazing to have you here it's great to see the Luxembourg perspective on things and um I hope I introduce you correctly was that all fine for you or do you want to add something perfect the introduction was perfect I'm just enjoying the comments I'm reading through them as well I'm I'm used to being an audience member on your channel so this is the first for me too yeah yeah no um it's great to have you here I was very excited to hear that you actually watched the video so thank you very much for being for being a watcher absolutely and um and we would love to know a little bit about Luxembourg because to be honest Luxembourg is not well known I think uh about what happens politically and we can see here you know the what happened after the European elections so my first question for you would be um what is your takeaway from Luxembourg like what what happened maybe you can explain a bit how your politics works well again thank you for this very cool introduction we are a very small country and not as many people tend to look over at what we're doing uh the overall process ended up being more or less as we expected uh we didn't have a very big rise in the you know more extremes uh on the right they only had you know one 2% more uh than five years ago but it was just enough for them to to get their seat unfortunately my party lost the seat uh we we we had a very good score but Vis A how the others did uh we did not manage to keep a second seat and obviously the Socialists performed incredibly well with mangle from uh the which is part of the snd having incredible School obviously being boosted uh from his role as vice president uh that he took over U two years ago so yeah overall more or less what we expected so so you're you're from the Democratic party right you're here you consist for the viewers I'm highlighting it now it's this one here I assume exactly and um you're yeah you're you're Affiliated to renew Europe right and um we do a lot higher level in our channel so we look at how renew Europe does throughout Europe and our renew um and um we're wondering so you lost a seat in Luxembourg and renew lost a lot of seats throughout Europe right are you concerned are you worried about the future of renew or are you thinking we could get some new members to you know make it stronger I think we should all be worried I think it's very clear we're Liv in a democracy when when people are not voting one way or another that informs us and that tells us uh whether we're doing something right or wrong I mean I'm fairly uh new in the political landscape in Luxemburg as well but uh as anyone who wants to have a uh a role of responsibility a role of leadership we need to take Collective responsibility for what's happened and I think we've got a lot to learn uh we've got to unfortunately or fortunately learn from those who do it best especially when when it comes to reaching young voters again U I've been watching your channel for a very long time um but unfortunately the majority of young people get informed now on Tik Tok and they'd rather watch you know Jordan B eating sweets and talking about how he tends to consume sugar before a debate than informing themselves um I'm guessing we're more or less the same age lambertus I'm not sure yeah I'll be very open I'm 35 so I look younger I think yeah I'm 35 yeah incredible but uh I be when I'm 60 I'm going to be laughing I'm going to look like 14 it's goingon to be great incredible you know I I think it's it's time for us to take responsibility and I think all over Europe as well we we don't see enough young people entering politics there's still this uh mystical element about uh the European Parliament especially where it's like this far away thing obviously coming from Luxburg is not that far away because we also do have a very big part of the parliament based here but um for for for the majority of Europeans I feel like we're not getting as engaged as we should and but what should I mean sorry to interrupt you but what can we do like this is what I tried with the channel right but what what can the European Parliament do to to improve this do you have any any ideas I think it's it's about communicating what it does and why it's so crucial and about communicating the main themes that we fail to communicate during this campaign which are European Unity at uh at you know the the foremost uh issues of importance uh communicating the need for a shared European Defense we're not we're not talking about these big issues that uh European Unity is here to solve we're we're not talking about the real things we we we we tend to get lost in the differences between our political groups and who's pulling a little bit more right a little bit more left a lot more right a lot more left but I feel like we we've really lost uh the big picture which is about our survival when you look at the last 50 years um Europe has lost almost half its Global share of GDP that we we we can only act if we act as one and I'm here I'm preaching to the choir because obviously there's few people that see this picture uh more than you but uh we've got to communicate that back Europeans and I feel like a lot of European parliamentarians they tend to go to Brussels and disappear for five years yeah yeah 100% 100 tell me what you've been up to yeah yeah I know and um actually thanks for the chat politics for fun is our first Super Chat so I appreciate it thank you very much he's a question for you kristos he asked kristos will renew focus on Tik Tok now um maybe your party and renew is Tik Tok the new way to communicate with the youth is that is that a fair point um without revealing too much about my own personal Journey either I'm going to say that I am uh heavily invested in ensuring that we explore all avenues of communicating with with people because the the responsibility of a politician is to find the Town Square and what started in ancient Greece on top of a stone in the middle of the Agora whatever it is it is today we we gota we got to be there so right okay okay then um maybe maybe if we look a little bit at I know it's a week after the election but I would really like to ask you about the winners and also the losers of the election I think there's big names already floating around but also for your from your persective what are what are the winners if you if I asked you about that or who are the winners in my country I mean undoubtedly when you look at the scores Charles gin who was leading my list uh even though he you know he received a few more a few less votes than he had last time around he was still elected by far first in the country that's incredibly clear then uh the Socialist is he did we put him on here is he here or 1 two 3 four five six seventh on the picture there there you this guy here right sh yeah so would you would you say he's top level like would you say he's like the the top performer from the the biggest winner in Luxembourg so should we put him in Euphoria here or what would you absolutely I mean Charles gin I have to say um because I I do talk a lot about young people getting involved in politics and as he says as well um you know at 72 years old he's definitely not the youngest right have never met I grew up in the Euro bubble in Luxembourg and I've never met someone who understands an me that understands better the inner workings of the European Union as Charles gin does I mean his view uh on the responsibilities of the European Union Vis A the African continent uh Visa uh global gateway uh his understanding of the framework of the European Investment Bank and what it does as a but he's so he's very Pro Europe in that sense absolutely there's there's nobody more Pro Europe uh and I mean considering your you know you're part of renew and all that and um your party so your part is also very pro- Europe right which is why right right right and then you you had of course markangel I'm not sure if you have him there in the pictures might not I might not the vice president of the European Parliament and the lead candidate for the Socialists he had an incredible score uh he's a very kind a very passionate politician involved in politics for all the good reasons and I think while I'm saying this I'm also realizing for some people who might be surprised uh at the fact that I'm talking very nicely about politicians and other parties in luxur it is like this we we all know each other we meet at the market almost every Saturday uh we talk with each other we are pro-european if M kangel does well and he represents ideas I'm happy for him uh you know if someone from the green does well I'm happy for them it's uh it's a bit of a different culture so so I me that's a good question um polarization right because if I look if I look at Germany where I live I'm not German but if I look at Germany you can see you know there's a contingent that vot votes very far right there's a contingent that votes very far left and there's a bit of polarization in the country would you say that's less in Luxembourg yes absolutely it's just very difficult to say the same thing and hope the same thing among the young population uh we saw here one of one of the one of the issues that defined the young vote uh was uh the Young goinging uh tragedy unfolding in Gaza and um it really divided the young vote it polarized the young vote I had a lot of uh people that I know that came to me and said oh I voted further right than I used to or I voted further left than I used to it's you know we all collectively I think did a horrible job at um conveying to people how much agency uh and how many limitations we have to influence the situation on the ground I was of the opinion and I am glad that we we we tow that line of we cannot overpromise to have influence where we don't um I didn't want to have that on my U on my consciousness of having promised things that I can't deliver on right but it definitely polarized uh young people very much and you see that because we have we have uh arrived at a point in time that unfortunately any civilization comes to uh because I do like to see a big picture where uh we like simplistic slogans um we do we do I'm very worried about the future of Europe I was I was uh I was very worried about coming onto your channel as well a week after the elections because I've I am unfortunately slightly pessimistic um about the future outlook for the European Union I've never been as worried about our Unity as I have been right now and unfortunately as a politician you can only say that after elections right before that you're just kind of stick to the to theery well here is not here let's talk about Simplicity I have a difficult question for you or maybe it is easy or yes or no uh Tom bres Tom brex is from the chat uh thank you very much by the way for uh for the for the Super Chat asks you does kristo stand for their federalization of the EU actually it's a yes or no question isn't it kristos easy let's go so no question yes uh um I will refer to my European School educations to be able to give you Clues as to where I stand uh on European integration I wish that it was a yes or no question but I've got to be pragmatic right I am no longer an activist I spent about 12 years uh you know being an activist being a political commentator I I now have to unfortunately take responsibility for guiding uh my society as much as I can when elected one way or another and so I would definitely move towards more integration but I can't give you a blanket statement on things that I know I know are so far away right I wish I could tell you lambertus I wish I could give you yes or no answer but don't you think some topics though I mean if you ask me right there's some areas again I don't want to give too much opinion away but some areas where I'm like it probably doesn't make sense but in some areas um for in instance defense isn't more integration there complete makes complete sense absolutely but there's there's so many things to to get done I mean nationalism is a problem everywhere we we we you know for the first time ever my party decided to vote um in favor of recognizing one of our languages here in luxur which is the national language luxemburgish has a European language and you see that there's a lot of this the sentiment like how much can we keep back um one of the main themes in our elections was the principles of unanimity and we wanted to uh we we we the government uh which my party uh is a member of um has decided to to keep you uh to keep um you know the veto right uh Visa V fiscal uh policies and so you see that this the there's protectionism or a form of protectionism growing in every European country everyone's trying to cling a little bit of their power uh when you enter the political system and I don't know if uh it's because I come from a small country that I feel like I'm I'm comfortable talking so openly about these things but I think when you enter politics and you realize that it really is the way that some people on the outside of it imagine it you kind of understand why there are so many roadblocks being put on the way when things are comfortable because people get comfortable to the powers and uh you know the abilities that government gives them so absolutely I mean when you asked me about defense I mean when when you look at our inability to act United uh VAV all these big conflicts around the world it's real big shame and then um I saw recently uh the country of my birth Greece is you know lobbying the Israeli government to try and build an iron dome for itself uh then you look at uh you know the priorities in Lithuania and Poland where they're really you know ramping up their defense capabilities and then you see who's not doing it and so yeah we need more it's so hard right because everyone has a different history and background right so for example like you said the Baltic states I mean they know they have a history of like a bad history with Russia for example so I guess they are more inclined to then see the threat or in their eyes a bigger threat than for example a state like I don't know Spain maybe who is way very very far away from from the front line but moving away from that topic because we have another Super Chat thank you very much Jimmy Mary uh again I'm throwing curve balls at you crystal I sorry I hope that's okay don't you worry I saw the I saw the same question I thought we gota answer that let me read out let me read it out so everyone can hear it that's not viting so what's your stance on the development and deployment of nuclear uh nuclear technology in support of the Renewables there you go just just to make sure we're talking about nuclear energy right as a source of let's assume it is let's assume is yeah um we have decided to be clearly against it again there are various uh reasons why luxur takes that stance uh but on my part I have to tell you that the line is we're clearly against developing nuclear Tech further I know it will disappoint some people but uh that's the reality of Luxburg that's that's always tful is that like a whole Luxenberg think do the parties agree with that all of them or is there different parts of different stances only the right and luxg disagrees with that statement on this issue so who are the for I mean sorry I don't know a lot abouts part the re yeah you've got you've got your ECR there that's that's what we consider that's what you you consider okay starts and then of course you have the de conservative that are not party you can see you can tell by you can tell by the election results that we have non-parties participating so you've got right left as well that didn't perform very well um you've got the pirate party and the vote I'm I'm a fan actually of a lot of the things that Vault tends to say but unfortunately I'm not sure that they are approaching uh Europe uh the right way because we are still a Europe of Nations and you gota you got to be integrated in these societies one of the main subjects issues that I had going into these elections was representation only about 15% of our European compatriots in Luxemburg vote in Luxembourg in a country where 50% of the population is uh Europe European but not luxemburgish so we have a huge issue there and even in this country you got to be integrated into your Society otherwise uh yeah you're not contributing as much as you may think but you could also I mean you need to move on to the the final question but my last question on that just to like pick a little bit on you can you not also have a form of identity and like a um like in a federal model like look at Germany Germany is a federal state um and I would say and again if there's Germans in the chat correct me if I'm wrong um but you know all the different um bundes Landa so the provinces they still have their identity I'd say I mean Bavaria is very different to Berlin area model yeah I'm not against that all I'm saying is that political parties fundamentally they are an expression of a group of people uh organizing together to advocate for a or a certain amount of things and you got to do it on the ground so vault is approaching things uh with a with a with a let's say top down view right political parties fundamentally they got to be Grassroots movements growing from the very bottom and part of the problem that we have in Europe actually is that at the moment a lot of these established parties have lost that touch with their base and so other parties have come up but that's a whole other discussion they have grown by 500% though from one me to five I mean that's not bad yeah look at those numbers yes yeah but Christ maybe before we go to the last question who you think the losers are um you ran right last week for an me I I understood that correctly oh well I mean you what what which candidate were you in the list uh so we we don't have uh numbered lists like in other countries but I was the fifth candidate out of six awes so based on the pattern of voting it's uh it's difficult but I had a respectable score so I'm very happy and I think we we all contribute you know every we as you can see most parties in Luxemburg elect one MEP so it really takes a team and I was very proud to be on that team with SH go no it's awesome awesome achievement um I hope you run again in five years then huh all right okay so we're going back to your loser of the night it doesn't have to be someone from Luxembourg but if you do have someone from Luxembourg great so yeah who do you think was there I think the biggest loser of the night uh was Europe unfortunately all of us you are very pessimistic man Crystal like yeah at the moment I am I think and I think we need to we need to take responsibility for what we did and uh let's see let's see what happens on the 30th of June we're all looking at France I mean I come from a tiny country that knows what happens when France and Germany don't get along and um we are we're all looking at what the big players are going to do right y y okay fair enough so Europe is your loser for the night I I would have to disagree with you a little bit but that's fine let's let's go to the um to the chat again because there's more questions you don't mind me throwing a curve ball at you right Christal okay so Mark asked a question what about the legalization of cannabis last thing I heard was that Luxembourg with withdrew from their plans no anything around that unfortunately I'm not cool enough to have any to be able to show you uh but you're allowed to have up to four plants in your house and grow them oh really smoke them in your own uh in in your own uh space and unfortunately we haven't gone to the step where you're able to buy legal cannabis at a pharmacy yet but it's still a plan and our youth so our young liberals in Luxembourg are very very active and continuing to push for that right right right right okay no very cool um oh okay there's another actually yeah there's another question um I'm not sure if that's a question you can answer Krist so don't worry if you can't but he's asking as far as I can see Vault actually supports nuclear power is that true sorry I want to know so I can see where to cost support do you know kristos otherwise in or overall generally I know you're not from Vault so it's a bit of a another curve ball but I want to say that what I understood was Vault was supporting nuclear energy as part of the transition which was again right yeah it'sit unclear area seems to be seems to be a touchy topic this nuclear power a lot of people um have strong opinions on it yeah I understand it because we're talking about energy Independence and a lot of the decisions that Europe will need to take in the next few years have to do with our ability to be energy independent but we'll see but from the luxembourgish perspective we're not going to be able to support that and there's clear reasons why I will give you a little hint it's called K okay I'll look I'll look it up I'll look it up um kristos it was amazing to have you here um so for everyone um yeah please thank FR you can find his details in the description as mentioned he's from the Democratic party in Luxembourg who won one me last week and um yeah great to have you here and if you have any close if you want to say anything to close the session then happy to do so kristos lambertus it was a pleasure talking to you congratulations for having this great Channel and I keep I look forward to looking at your videos your next on yeah we have some in production so perfect thank you very much we yeah all right okay so before our next guests arrive we can have another look at our our overview oh and by the way let's let's let's talk about nuclear energy for for a little bit more um because there seems to be a lot of people talking about it and also asking about my opinion um I'll be honest with you I think Germany's approach of closing their nuclear plans at the start of the year I thought that was uh or a year ago I think that was a shot in the foot right I don't understand what the strategy was behind that um whether to build new nuclear plants I think that's a whole other debate because that's so much investment um and we have to see what return it would bring right and also I just another comment that Vault apparently is very Pro um nuclear energy just for the people that had that question in the chat awesome all right so uh let me just change my screen okay so we started doing this National parties here you below that currently have no European group and aligning them to the European groups and seeing how our eventual part a parliament can look like and as you can see IFD we've given to the indd group because we think that they will rejoin after the French election once Leen has uh is not in full campaign mode now the big question is I would love to hear the comments um I would love to hear the comments about this where do you think fides will go because fides they were kicked out of the Epp group so the EP is the center right political group in the European Parliament they were kicked out about I think a couple years ago and I think it's hard to say where they go because we have the ECR with whom they've been flirting a little bit um and we have the IND so the ECR is a right-wing conservative and the indd is the farri group so where again asking the chat where do you think they will go I think at the moment I would stick to almost non-aligned I think it's very very difficult um of where of where to put them so let me know or maybe the ECR we the ECR could also be a be a be a possibility the one thing that is for sure though I think fides and the a below I think they can work together yeah here we can see some chats so St Eloy you think fides will stay neutral exactly either indd or they won't join any group from ANA yeah this is exactly my thinking so there's also a reason why they weren't part of a European group in the last couple of years right even though the ECR and the indd existed so it's very very difficult to say um I can do a poll I think poll is a good idea I have never actually done a poll so I'm not sure if it's possible let me have a look if I can do a poll that'd be a really good way to do it and we go ah I can start a poll perfect will fides will fides go so bear with me so will they go nonaligned will they go ECR or the option three will be will they go in and so all right I started the poll so please let me know what you think and then we can move them along um Vol Netherlands very good question egam egam wo where Vault Netherlands is they currently are well I'd say non-aligned because Vault Germany yes you're right they're part of the greens but currently vault is looking at whether they want to go to renew or whether they want to go to the uh to the greens so they're having I think an internal vote of their I don't know how many members 20,000 members not sure and um once that vote is done that vote will decide where they go so again let me know where you think they'll end up I have a sneaky feeling they might they might go to Greens again I'm not sure how well they uh are working with uh how well let me let me let me rewind I think it depends who gives them the better deal so they could go either way and time will tell but when we get to them in the list we can make our prediction all right so where will fides go non-aligned is the big answer so 56% of you think non-aligned so let's for now put them on nonaligned all right so nonaligned for the fides movement cool um then we have the five star movement we're going to skip that very briefly and we're going to have a look at buar because the five star move will talk maybe later with one of the guests that we have so buar vag is a super interesting case right she's not really right-wing she's not really leftwing she's not really Center either she's a whole mix of things so she's really governing or her policies or her man Manifesto is really all about the problems Europe faces so for example um when it comes to Russia and Ukraine they are not exactly Pro Ukraine they are more um let's leave Ukraine be and try to find peace with Russia whatever however they want to do that and at the same time they're very strong a migration and at the same time they do endorse some left leaning social policies but they don't want to go too extreme on the on the woke side of things so there really are mix of things so if we look at the European Parliament big groups I really don't see where they can fit I really really don't and honestly I think she and maybe you saw my last video I said the same thing I think she's most likely to either stay non-aligned with a couple of others or actually start a new group with a couple of others which we'll get into later later this video so for now I am going to give her a potential new group and as you can see now on my screen here I've now have potentially she will gain six seats but she'll need seven countries and 25 MPS to create a new group so throughout this whole live stream we're going to see if she can get the numbers because she cannot form a new group with other parties unless seven countries and 25 MEPS are with her so that will be very very interesting interesting to see all right um then I think we can move on to our our next guest so we have someone joining called franchisco he is actually from Portugal and he is the founder of something called the OS 230p please check our description you can find the link to the to his Instagram page and his and his and his company he teaches international law um and EU law and political science in the University of Lisbon so really an expert when it comes to Portuguese politics and like I said he founded the organization OS 230 which aims to um um several projects to improve democracy and lastly my God there's a lot to him he's also a political analyst on TV so really really great guest to have on and without further Ado franchisco I think you're here so hi nice to have you on our live stream franisco hello I'm here

night long night yeah yeah yeah no really really cool we were actually um for the audience here franchisco and myself were lucky enough to be invited to the uh European Parliament over the last couple weeks to really see the elections unfold and um so we met there and um now I'm lucky enough to have him on the stream so great to have you what we want to talk about Francisco is first of all Portugal because again I'm gonna have to find Portugal first I am no expert when it comes to Portuguese politics and we would love to hear a little bit not yet exactly and we'd love to hear a little bit about you about you know how are things in Portugal how did the election unfold um you know just a bit of your opinion or not how it all worked maybe you can give some words the same as the U elections in general not a lot of surpris I think people were expecting a lot of different things but to be honest uh the results of last week were not uh a big surprise for for everyone and even in the National political sphere nothing changed considerably so the biggest surprise that we had in our results was that people were expecting that shega that is part of the ID group shega means enough so enough of this enough of corruption enough uh of jobs for the boys um enough of poverty so they are the the party that is sitting on the right of our micycle in the Portuguese micycle and they got a huge result uh in the last uh national elections in March so they got 50 MPS and we are 230 that's why the name of my project it's 230 uh and the other two main parties the party that is now in government the social Democrats that are that is part of the EP family and the Socialist that was in government uh since 2015 um they quite at the the same results uh but uh with more votes for the social Democrats so that's why our government changed but shga stayed at the third place with a huge result in March and people were expecting that they would continues to have uh a really good result here in the EU elections probably with the four MEPS but they only got two and they were really close to the third candidates that were the uh liberal initiative that are like our liberals and the first me to to be part of the the reew group so they were the surprise so third and fourth place were the surprise because people were expecting shga to have more than this more than two MEPS and inative liberal was also a huge surprise because his candidate again a lot of traction he was a former leader of this party uh and the they built the entire campaign around him and he got also two MEPS they were not expecting they were expecting one and they got a huge result then the discussion was between would we have the the last spots in the pament and uh if the the parties of far left will still get them or not because in previous elections they both have uh they both had two each one so the left block and the Communist and they lost one each uh and deliver the the party that is part of the the Green family was almost getting uh one me uh but was not possible for them uh the first place uh was also a tough um race and the the Socialists won but not with a wide margin so they cannot capitalize this game also for negotiations of our national budget or saying that how if you'll have elections now we'll be the government so not a lot of things changed with these elections okay interesting though but let let me let me zoom in and um I see the politics for fun question in the in the chat and I'll get there I'll get to your question and just I first want to hammer in a little bit on what you said franisco so chga didn't do as well as they as expected um but in all other countries the far right probably did better or at least met expectations so why was this different in Portugal in your opinion were there reasons you think why chga didn't do as well I think political analysts always try to give only one reason but normally there are more than that one of the main you knowk Tok it has to fit in a Tik Tok Francisco yeah yeah and they are really good also on Tik Tok so I bet they party really smart on the those kind of tractions H and I I believe that one of the reason was the candidate the candidate that was not really good so on the debates he went poorly especially in individual interviews he start to have some cons uh some conspiracy theories like Jews were Jews knew about the 911 so that's why not a lot of Jews died in the 911 uh then the problem of milosovic was with his wife he was a nice guy uh then regarding the Second World War the Japanese didn't invade the us because US citizens had weapons so it looked like a nice guy until he start to talk because he was a diplomat normally diplomats don't say those kind of things but then when you you let them talk let him talk uh people were quite surprises and even voters that vote for shga in the last election were like okay I I don't buy this guy so uh the thing is the same as far or extreme right movements in Europe they need strong leaders and CH as a strong lead leader a guy that it's intelligent uh has a good cap capacity of U rhetoric um is smart on his moves but the candidate for the European elections was not this was something different another reason is people don't buy this speech against EU so some weeks ago they were not having this speech against the EU but then they were like supporting parties like um salvini lean also Vox even from a different political family uh the leader of shega was in their rally so people were like okay we like the European Union we cannot start to criticize and having the same speech as in France or in Italy because we are the ones receiving the money so it doesn't make sense in Portugal to criticize oh let's change this Europe but we'll still get the U funds and we get a lot of the the fund so I is like the highest so sorry to interrupt you Francisco but like um um Public public support for the EU isn't that like one of the highest in Portugal out of all countries in Europe yeah yes but also the turnout was not so high as expected so people love the U but they don't go there and vote but that was also bad for shga because one of the main reasons of an amazing result they they had on the the national elections they they got a lot of votes from the extension so now because not a lot of people in our turnout uh was not so high so was almost half of the the turnout we had uh in March uh they couldn't get like the protest votes people that were upset with everything and they decided to to go and uh and vote and uh in these elections they they didn't get this but people I believe in Portugal they still uh know that EU is really important for the development of the country and the political speech on other countries doesn't make sense here and Francisco we have a super chat from politics for fun so thank you very much politics for fun which is why couldn't lra elect in your opinion it's a difficult thing um because it was controversial since the beginning so the candidate was Francis pal perio he was U not part of uh the structure of the party so they have a primary elections and he was a candidate and got a lot of support and brought even people to Sy sympathizers of the the party to to vote uh but even the leadership of the party after the election so they had like um uh the the first round and the second round and between the first and the second round they were trying to change the rules for him to not be elected and to be the candidate of the party and this diminished the image of the party and the leaders of the party were not able to to support him properly but he did pretty well in the campaign so even in the debates was one of the the surprises uh but then uh people were expecting and like until the last minute people were expecting him to be elected but it was not possible in the end also because of the the ma the method of uh counting the the seats were was not uh enough for him to to get the the last spot in the the European power and franisco I'm just conscious of people that might not know lra what kind of party are they like what do they stand for yeah so they are part of the Green family but they they are left so they are left of the Socialist part it's not the same position as the the European fames so greens normally in the the European family they say we are not left or right we are post ideological here they are clearly left and the founder was part of the left block uh so he tried he left the left block and said I want to be left but European left so with more commitment to the European project so one of the their main causes is like the the same with other party named p uh that it's people animals and nature it's like climate action uh gender equality so those are those um those um strongest ideas so every debate they they try to to uh to narrow this to those main points always right and maybe maybe then lastly last question on Portugal before we move to the next topic is uh so um the uh the party in I'm going to I'm going to mispronounce this initia Lial exactly so that's one of the few wins that renew has had throughout all of Europe was them right um again how come again probably not an easy answer but how come they did well why why were they against the trend in Europe when it comes to Liberal Liberal parties yeah I I I I believe the same with she so the the lead candidate the lead candidate is a is a a person that was a former leader of of the party uh he had really strong um popular rates in in Portugal he also known because he had like he did something outside politics so people appreciate this and uh he is a strong Communicator so even in the debates uh he tried to to present that okay I agree with Europe but I want some reforms and especially with the young people because they also have some traction on social media I think they they played really well and maybe some people that were thinking about voting for other parties and were upset upset because of the candidates of other parties saw him as a credible person and they decide to support another thing that regarding social media that we saw also in the last election and plays uh out I not say significant part but at least some role is that some entertainers like comedians are starting to interview politicians right and people that were outside of the bubble they are starting to having the first contact with politicians through those channels and uh this person figed is also really good on that so right he not so young as other candidates like for example the candidate of uh the Social Democrat right but he has like this young mind and he has a lot of traction with the young people yeah yeah all right okay cool I want to park Portugal here um maybe just very quickly before we go to the next topic topic Francisco just to the chat because I can see lots of discussions Happening Here uh Francisco will only be on for another 10 minutes probably so if there's any questions make sure you let us know and I will ask them for you um exactly before we move to the to the next thing so Francisco you live in Portugal but I know you also know Spain so so if it's all right with you let's quickly look at what how Spain worked out because they have 61 seats so they are very very important in um in EU politics and have a lot of power as in send a lot of MPS and maybe the same as you did with Portugal maybe quickly and especially also some of the non-affiliated parties you want to give us a quick overview of what happened there and what are the surprises so that's like 10 questions at once but go for it okay so uh first of all I think we we discussed a bit of uh um the Spain uh Spanish representation also because for Portugal was also an argument that our votes uh are not so decises as other countries and some uh commentators on television were saying okay the popular party will elect more MEPS than the entire Portugal so we are not the ones deciding the the main the main decisions at the U level but uh to be honest I I think Spain was not a surprise also if you look for the results of also La selection people say okay but the party of Pedro Sanchez the Prime Minister lost the the elections yeah but they lost it also uh back in the previous elections but they did something that they copied for for from Portugal and uh that is now also a thing in in Germany that is to get uh a coalition of parties that could have more um as a stronger position in parament than the the alternative so basically par popular he part of the EP family they also won the the national elections but they were not able to form government because all the left they they joined against them uh even though they didn't have the support of Vox so they didn't said that Vox would be part of a Coalition in government they decid that they didn't want partio popular to form government and Pedro Sanchez always did this idea of Antonio Koster our former prime minister that was to gather the the left even with some some difficult agreements and for him it was even more difficult he he had some agreements with the with independen parties and uh he also to reach a compromise he decided to give amnesty for p de Mo and other people inal so yeah I think for him this was not also a a loss so they they didn't win but they resisted so they still have a lot of support but uh the surprise was that another Coalition that is part of the government sumar and suar it's a coalition of several left parties uh they got a poor result another thing that we should underline is that Vox didn't grow a lot but they are still the the third Force but then we have uh some different realities here like sakaba Fest like it it ends the party so let's finish the party right of course it's the name that shows that it's anti-corruption anti-establishment and they they had a pretty nice result getting uh three MEPS so um I think for the national uh interpretation of European elections it's not a big change but it's impressive that partio popular uh won again uh that was also good for this yeah the the EP family was good to show that they won in several countries uh but Soy was didn't have a hug loss so for them it was also okay I think in the EP group right partio popular is the second biggest I think after CDU ISU so yeah let me let me quickly respond to some things in the chat Ana held Bar C Sorry probably screwed up your name Nordic results if we have time at the end we will uh we are going to cover Romania and Eastern Europe also so for any Romanians on the call but we will try to um and then another question here is from Lucas KERO do you Think Costa could be elected president of the European Council do you have any opinion on that Francisco yeah yes I do think so um he has the support I think was one of the biggest news in Portville so in the the speech of our prime minister in the elections night he said we'll clearly support Antonio Costa for becoming uh the president of the the European Council and he showed his support other parties show the Liberals didn't show shega didn't show their support but the one that counts is our prime minister he's a Social Democrat he seated also in the European Council and he said that you will uh also try to persuade others to vote for our former prime minister so I I I do think he he has a strong CH chances also because the negotiations that will happen tomorrow with these results we know that the the Socialists and Democrats are still strong in the the cycle but they are not the first uh party so probably we'll still haveo Von as the president of the commission Roberto Meola as the the president of the European Parliament uh the Liberals will probably lose this this presidency and will get the high representative maybe kajak kalas and the the strongest figure to get the the presidency of the European Council in my opinion it's Antonio C the prime minister of Denmark has some chances but I think he's a stronger candidate because he has a lot of experience in the European Council and he could be someone that can build Bridges between different ideologies because he's a a really diplomatic guy and uh he's not someone that wants or loves to do a lot of reforms but can sympathize with different people and reach some compromise right I mean just for everyone to know how how it will go on yeah we how how how things will happen so Tomorrow there's an informal meeting between the the the European Council Members which are pretty much the heads of state um and there will talk about the presidency positions also the commission president so that'll be very interesting and at the end of the month there's also an official meeting so tomorrow's inofficial meeting at the end of the month I think 28th of June or something um there's the official meeting between the heads of state where these things will then be cemented I I assume um so that's just for the audience to know so tomorrow is an exciting day who knows maybe we'll create a video on it um Francisco Before I Let You Go we have a little tradition here or tradition it is a tradition now on the live stream where we look at winners and losers um so we have some candidates here below from who in your eyes are your winners of this European election in my opinion like following the um what was I was saying I would say that Antonio car now as a a highway to go for for this position so in my opinion is's one of the the winners of this election I believe also Georgia Melone with an impressive result uh in Italy and she was a candidate but kind of a fake candidate because she will not be a member of the European Parliament but she she had an impressive uh sorry I miss that franisco you just cut outg Mone of and I think uh it also shows that she has some support of um a big support in in Italy then I would say Jordan bardel also an Italian name but you have to say it maybe with a French accent because he he's really nationalist uh so he he he's only 28 years old and he won uh the elections in in France and probably will play also an important role in National politics and May a candidate to become the next prime minister in France let's see what happens in the end of June and July but the losers are uh two important figures for Europe especially because they are the the ones that represent the countries that normally leads the European project I'm talking about macro and schuls yeah different loss I think for maon it's even more dramatic because the on that that one was the extreme right and now the the left is getting together uh fors um and because Germany has a different political system uh I think it will not affect uh him right now but also in the political negotiations at the EU EU level I think for him it shows that he's not so strong as angl Maricel was uh and the last one that I would say that at the Lost uh last week was Robert fto uh also even though like people would sympathize with him because he had terrible weeks at weeks ago because he was shot um he was not able to win this election and this kind of speech uh criticizing the support to Ukraine didn't uh collect the support of the majority of people in Slovakia he but he still let's have a look how much he won uh maybe quickly go to plls of PA Slovakia one second still had a nice result but yeah still nice result I think right here six six seats right no five five five yeah yeah he was expell off the Socialist yeah the family yeah um so maybe final question if you still have one minute um and this again this is like a curveball do you see any new groups forming in the European Parliament or do you think it's unrealistic I I'll maybe a rebranding of them because it's weird people will say that okay ECR they are not so extreme right as the ID but at the same time for example you look at France and then you have reemal part of ID and the Recon the party of Zur saying that we are more right than them but then they are ECR so sometimes it doesn't make sense um I believe that Georgia Melone will realize that now she gained also some traction to to start to make more demands but probably she will try to re uh reorganize some of the the families and try to have a stronger voice but maybe not with the ones that are not pro-european project on this way or mainly the ones that are not pro Ukraine with the aggression that we are seeing right now so that's for me the big issue right Ukraine it's they're too far apart the the two rightwing camps if you ask me yeah yes and the are part in some countries part of the same government for example Melone and salvini they are part of the same government they support each other salvini a worse result uh but uh if you saw the the political speech on the night of the election of Georgia Mone uh Georgia Mone was saying oh but I also want to congratulate the parties of this Coalition so she's worried also about their their success right yeah yeah yeah no super interesting super interesting um franchisco I think we talked about everything U we want to talk about to talk about but I have one more important question for you before we close I promise this the last one who will win the Euro Cup I I believe it's Portugal I think Germany has strong chances I saw some polls saying that's England but I believe they are coming home earlier uh so they they don't have a lot of chance France is also a strong um country and as a strong Squad to to be considered but I believe Portugal this year has a stronger team than in 2016 but uh let's see if the stars will be aligned and we'll reach the final what about you for you forgot Netherlands what do you think of Holland Netherlands I don't think they they will have the same chances as the main ones but they are a strong theme of course but not so strong as Portugal France and I'll say Germany right Francisco it's time for SP played really well in the last game noran countries win the the Euro Cup so yeah yeah yeah no franchisco it was great to have you here so everyone um thanks please thank franchisco for his time and please see his details in the description if you want to follow him on uh on Instagram he's got great content especially if you're a Portuguese speaker um and Francisco yeah any last words I mean thank you very much for making it to the to the stream yeah now just I want to congratulate once again for your incredible work this is really important because more than fighting for uh to avoid exstension and to promote turnouts it's to promote informed vote people should be aware that they play a role in society and I would like to encourage people not only to participate in elections but participate in the the European project and there are several ways to do it and throughout the engagement I think will can create a better Community yeah thank you Frisco you're doing the same thing right so also congratulation on your work and um I'm sure this won't be the last time we're on a stream together thank you so much friend thank you Frisco I'll see you I'll see you next time thank you bye bye all right okay so there's quite a few questions in the chat uh that we didn't get to but let me let me go through them um if I can answer some of them so firstly here let me let me scroll up uh what are the available pictures and winners and losers based on well we asked our guests beforehand who their winners and losers are um and of course you also have some generic ones and edit it into to the board because otherwise of course this would be quite quite difficult to do um and then someone else here Andre as someone who from Slovakia I don't see f fito as a loser maybe he won only five seats but you need to consider that Breakaway clas also won a seat and Far Right Republic won two seats yes that's true so I think maybe we can brand it as the rightwing or far right but was definitely a successful night for that for them but for fito himself of course he did lose a seat right so um or own only won five seats so maybe that's the the the way we can uh we can spin it um also by the way while while I have all of you here um if you we are we are not sponsored by the EU nothing like that uh we are an independent Channel and brand so please do check out patreon if you do want to support us further um and also the super chats and questions that you make they really help us go further so really appreciate all of that please check it out it's um it's in the description um of the of the live stream so let's go back to party allocation before our next guest arrives so what we've been doing here is going through all of these parties and aligning them to groups and next up is confederation so Confederation is a more far-right or yeah far-right party in in Poland and um they're not they're not good friends with peace um but um yeah exactly they they stand a bit more to the right are a bit more sympathetic to to uh to to Russia I'd say if I wanted to say it diplomatically and uh um and yeah they are currently non-aligned so they don't currently have a group that they're working with and to be honest if they were to join any group from an eate simpler perspective we really think that they have a good chance of joining the indd um and that's what we're going to give them so if they were I don't I don't see them going to the ECR especially because Pie is in the in the ECR so I think they they suit the indd much much better um the next one on the list um is a from Romania R and it's good timing because we our next guest is from Romania and or at least knows Romanian politics a lot better than I do and maybe he can definitely give a bit of uh input there his name is Andy mokan hopefully I've pronounced this U correctly and um he is well he's worked at the embassy of Romania in the Netherlands and he's currently a staff writer in the media department for EU andu so for anyone that doesn't know EU andu is an Instagram account or page or brand even and they have lots of great content on the EU and he's heavily involved in this so without further Ado I think Andy you're in the call hi Andy nice to have you in the Stream hi thanks thanks a lot for having me lamberto amazing I mean I've been watching on YouTube like for the past hour and I I love every second of it okay I'm happy I'm happy to hear it's one of our first like our third live stream so it's h it's definitely a new area we're getting into so great great to have you have you on the stream and um yeah we're super excited to talk about Romania because last time I felt we we we didn't talk enough about Romania especially because my knowledge in that area of Europe is definitely more limited than Western Europe like Germany Netherlands France Etc and maybe if I share my screen here and go to Romania I need to find them first here we go because Romania is really relevant they have 33 seats right it's big amount it's sixth biggest yeah sixth biggest after biggest yeah exactly so so where where the seats Go I mean it matters for the big European groups right about what Romania votes for yeah and and maybe maybe yeah go ahead go ahead Andy go kick off talk about Romanian politics right so just to set the stage to set the context right now Romania is like being governed by a coalition let's call it an Unholy Coalition of the two biggest parties now these two parties are the the the liberals the par National liberal which is in the EP and the social Democrats now obviously these two parties have been for the past 25 years the main two rivals on the Romanian political scene right and since since 2022 they they realized that they can gather a majority and have absolutely no real opposition in front of them and that's what they did uh justifying the need for stability due to the war due to the tense situation since 2022 so having that that background right now so this this big 10 Coalition for the past two years uh they actually got also as you can see almost 50% of the votes a clear absolute like majority in in in this uh elections which was expectable but um not to such a High degree so what happened here was that uh everybody was a bit stunned by the centrism that we apparently like uh because they uh this is also an important thing to understand about Romanian politics they might be Social Democrat and liberal to some degree but and they do vote in the European Parliament they do vote together with their groups but in National politics when we're talking on on on the internal stage they really are aren't that far apart they both are a bit conservative they really don't have that much of an ideology like the national liberals for example imposed some uh uh left-wing policies such as tax increases while the social Democrats uh tried to you know Foster growth in the business in the Romanian business depart like sector it's really not a coherent clear right or clear clear left uh ideology that they're pursuing so that's that's another thing to understand so let me just make it very clear right so just to summarize you have these big parties the the PSD and the p&l right those are the two short form what you explained and they as you can see here in the results they they kind of go together as a coalition and then they split up to snd and the EP is that is that what happens when Romanians when Romanians voted like when I voted like last week uh one week ago yeah yeah I was presented with uh on the voting like on the paper on the voting bulletin we literally had the the two logos of the parties in the same box wow when we voted so when you vote when you vote for snd in Romania you also vote for EP they had common lists and they just alternated you know one snd one ep one pen one p they just alternated that uh that MEP list and apparently yeah uh they they they got the majority of the vote but yeah we we can see that right um 40 48% together so 19 seats um which is uh exciting now maybe the party I really would love to learn a little bit more about is the a so this this the one here alante P I'm not even gonna try but the a yeah exactly maybe you can explain who they are what they what they stand for that kind of thing for people that don't know in the chat yeah absolutely so the alian Alliance for the UN Alliance similar to similar to Italian sounding a bit here alian so um they stand they're simply put uh so first of all they still haven't joined they still haven't joined any European political party uh group sorry um but mainly they um their main point the rain points uh in the past they've only existed since 2020 so they were a relatively new party so sorry the late 2019 they are very new on the Romanian stage uh on the political stage and it's very they have a mix right so they're traditionally right-wing almost I would say they're pretty much far right yes right but they also use a rhetoric found from former um also excuse the background noise as you can see I'm outside in my garden if you see no worri we can hear you fine we can hear you fine yeah perfect uh so uh they uh use some let's call it communist Nostalgia rhetoric in their uh in their propaganda let's call it so it's uh a bit of a mix they play on the populist uh good populist good old communist populist techniques for example they try to revive these great personalities from Romanian history like medieval kings and princes and literally on their campaign posters they had uh Vlad Vlad tayor as one of the the promoter so to say icons so they are um um opposed to um to everything Progressive everything on the green side everything there they're also opposed to uh problems such as abortion rights women's rights so uh traditional they support the traditional family they are against the LGBT community and and whatever that takes and obviously they are uh Pro um Orthodox christiany so they're also a bit involved into uh this uh this type of uh discourse publicly interesting and and maybe you've already mentioned it but just to clarify what's their position on Ukraine and Russia and everything now this is this is where things get interesting because uh as you as you know Moldova the Republic of mova of course yeah is ethnically a majority of yeah M malians are Romanian anyway it's like you could put it austrians and Germans something similar okay speak the same language same ethnic group let's call it right but obviously because mova was in the Soviet Union and so forth they got separated and didn't rejoin Romania now um this is slightly Pro there the our point of view the Aur point of view is that they um say that there are some territories in today Ukraine that once belonged in the inter War period in the 1920s and 1930s belonged to the kingdom of Romania and that still that is kind of the historical um Legacy the historical claim that we could have on that area and obviously they push for Union with the Republic of mdova the a that's why it's called the uh Union of Romanians the alliance for the union because you want to unionize the all of Romanians this nationalistic clear goal that they had and that's what the a also stands for they want that or they of course publicly not achievable and they they haven't really pressed on on on that point a lot on these uh the past years but that was one of their initial goals that's how they entered politics more or less and that's how their leader Georgia Simon entered politics in the first place through unionist movements like those um and um yeah as to ask your question to answer your question the on Ukraine is that they really don't the classical I'd say classical euroskeptic point of view that they shouldn't really support any kind of involvement with supplying weapons collaborating so we should you know we should keep to our own country our own interests our now there's also uh it's also been proven that uh they were partially funded at least a few years ago now it's a bit unclear they were funded by um um Russia uh they received uh they received funds and uh will'll get to another party the SOS Romania you can see it on the list there yeah yeah that's yeah that'll be the next one let yeah yeah but'll get I just want to I just want to Zone into Aur for a bit right because they're current it's five seats I mean that's almost as much as the smallest countries send an MEPS right it's not ins significant five seats and we are wondering or I am wondering do you think that they will join a political group on the EU level or not uh realistically if fides from Hungary doesn't join the ECR they like my prediction is that they will join ECR because I give you funny example a few years ago a few months ago sorry I believe in April or March Georgia Simon the leader of the Aur took a selfie with Melone and gifted her some like uh ancient Roman stuff because as you know Romania is also Latin country and try to play on that okay okay yeah yeah so um he will probably go now that they got five members in in the European Parliament they will probably try to align themselves to ECR if they don't uh have any kind of competition let's say mainly from fides that is the main conflict there because uh Transylvania yeah it's a mixed region ethnically speaking and they obviously have no good relationship with the let's call them you know from the Romanian perspective they call yeah the foreigners yeah yeah it's it's it's interesting too because uh I mean this is a small thing well it's it's interesting thing like um orbon from FES like wearing am go ahead uh I am for examp I am from Transylvania right I I have grown my whole childhood with Hungarian neighbors with and just so you can understand it's a bit of an inflated conflict the conflict doesn't exist really between people over here in Transylvania where we've lived for the past 500 years together in in peace and actual Harmony now obviously they find this as a reason to you know say ah but a scapegoat let's call it you know they find yeah but so so so is there there's a conflict um by the way first let me just there's a very nice comment Thiago Rosa wrote very interesting insight into Romanian politics for a West European like me so thank you Andy first of all um but let me let me quickly compare understand the conflict between fides and um and the Aur party is it is it because they both see you know like for example Orban from fidz wearing a greater Hungary shirt um that kind of conflicts with what Au want is it territorial in that sense or how how would you explain that now ideologically they are rather close so that's that's that's not the problem because they're both conservative in that matter now the problem is strictly I would believe um there is this this um area in the middle of in the middle of Romania called Saarland which is basically uh fil it is truly an exclave so it's surrounded by Romanian ethnicities and it's in the middle of the caran mountains that is where Orban once per year has a little visit to some thermal bats and there he has like uh like a huge support from the the Hungarian minority there and he basically R rallies up nationalism outside of Hungary for his own party for his own like it's I don't know how you could you could compare it to I don't know uh macron going to okay no to Belgium to to Flanders and you know inflating the French uh ethnicity there like it's it's it's uh that that's why this the Aur um are very much against it not because they wouldn't agree on common European problems it's simply this 100 year old rather stupid and artificially constructed conflict okay so I understand so let's let's check that part off like fides and Aur no thanks that's not going to work that's fine so if if fides like you mentioned doesn't join anyone or stays non aligned then Aur would have a chance with the ECR you're saying but how would that work with their Russia stance because normally what for me really makes you know what really is the difference between the IND and the ECR is their stance on Russia because ECR is definitely very Pro Ukraine and wants to continue to support Ukraine while the indd is a bit plaky you know doesn't really want to support yeah yeah like like Melone Melone has become a real fighter for Ukraine absolutely yeah um no I see that uh again another another good good or bad thing about Romanian politics these people don't really have an ideology if it comes to making alliances or trying to get into their you know to get their goals so right in the past in the past year that is so since you know we entered the election campaign uh because a thing to mention an important thing to mention I should have mentioned it earlier in Romania this year we have four rounds of Elections all of them yeah this uh this past week uh on the same day we had the local elections for the Mayors for the municipalities and the European ones right in SE in September we're having the presidential elections and in December the the Parliamentary elections so everything kind of changes because all of the campaign like this is a campaign year fully up until December everything ties together with the next election with the next election they have to it's it's it's it's a whole game plan so on that note um a will probably go into ECR to have the backing off to show that they're not so extremist and that they can join they can collaborate on the European LEL yeah yeah yeah yes so and they will for them it will not be a big problem to drop the not supporting Ukraine case yeah yeah yeah super interesting okay so so let's let's say they do join the ACR um let's go back to to the polls here so Romania um there are some other parties too we have the SOS Romania who's also unaligned maybe you can tell a little bit about like who are they are they also a more right-wing party or are they very different uh SOS is the most rightwing uh they are the uh they actually it was a surprise because they only won like everybody knew that they had like on the night of the election at the end of the at 12: P p.m. they had or 1200 a.m. sorry mid midnight they had 3.7% the th sold for getting into the apartment 5% everybody assumed they won't get in they're not gonna get it they won't get in and we woke we woke up in the morning and we we were like 5.01% and everybody was like all right we're sending these people we're sending these people in so so you have a 5% limit in Romania that is that is interesting okay okay yeah so the the the limmit for parties to get into the parliament is 5% and the limit for uh independent candidates is 3% so if you run as independent you 3% um right so this is yeah SOS Romania is a breakaway of the most right-wing elements of the Aur right they were actually uh like there it's a basically a cult of personality uh around this one person one lady um called called Diana Shaka Shaka s oos the first three letters of her name make the yeah it's a bit of a cult of personality as I told you and she she is a former lawyer which was a few years ago or sorry actual lawyer who a few years ago was on the Romanian Ren new Europe side so liberal very and so forth and um really since the pandemic uh she's turned conspiracy theorist uh uh all the just to I think the best exemplification for this is that two days ago she was invited and she went to an event at the Russian Embassy in Bucharest and she attended and there's photos so that is there's no clearer evidence than yeah so yeah unfortunately Romania is also sending two of these um including her the leader of the party uh to the European Parliament I do not think they will be able to collaborate with anyone either not indd for example you think that could work or not so much I mean if uh that might work with one condition though that uh she does a crash course in English very quickly and she learns how to speak it properly and she learns how to I like it's GNA be they are the absolute like how can I put this U every every type of conspiracy theory every type of uh uh communist nostalgia greater Romania uh scenario that they're playing on and apparently they got to 5% of the population mainly obviously rural population right okay we I I asked the chat for some questions for you Andy and we got quite a few so if you do still have a bit more time I would love to ask some of these so um Nathan thank you very question Nathan he asked will will the government of Romania accept a in a government or is there no chance they apparent L uh there was talk that the social Democrats last year might might collaborate with them if if the Aur got uh good result let's call it but since that really didn't happen there's absolutely no need to because they have this Grand Coalition between the two biggest parties they can do whatever they want basically they have uh what 30 35% lead on the Aur it's absolutely no not not on the table this option is getting further further and further away so more away than it is getting possible okay yeah another cool question here um oh it's it's the same I think it's from David yeah from David um would would the SOS Romania be open to create a new group on the European level with the afd and Confederation or other similar groups again this is a very very like you know thinger in the air kind of thing but maybe you have some ideas um so yeah the SOS collaborating with the IFD that would be what a day uh what a day well is definitely looking yeah go ahead go ahead sorry yeah I I don't really see that happening mainly again because on the based on the fact that uh even you know we've had the proven yeah Russian links Russian connections uh uh she would be simply accused that look now she's collaborating with the Germans what is this she's not in our Romanian like you know independent uh strong woman uh leading no it it it's not realistic and obviously okay with all that she's just let's call it an agent of chaos she doesn't really know how to collaborate okay okay interesting interesting she was kicked she was she was she was kicked out of her own rightwing party hour because she was too extremist and did like now she's absolutely against the a like yeah right wing versus very right wing it's yeah um okay there's lots of questions in this chat we're going to ask you two more one from um here Echo Andre Andy can you talk about Nik stefanut God I probably completely mispronounce yeah yeah that's no nik Stan yeah that's um the only independent candidate which ran in the European elections for us and actually won he is the first green elected in the history of the European Parliament from Romania and he is actually the vice president he's yeah he's and he is the vice president of the greens group and he actually got also a bit of a cult of personality but in a good way let's say because he actually managed to get 3.1% of the vote on his own as a personal candidate just like that and he managed to win because he was previous L elected in 2019 he is an MEP right now he's just getting his second mandate he was elected from the renew Europe so yeah he is yeah okay yeah correct absolute winner yeah yeah I I remember you tell sorry sorry to interrupt your answer you can Contin see in a minute but I remember from before the call you mentioned he's your winner so I I put him up there we prepared these beforehand so we have the right faces but go ahead yeah exactly he's your winner yeah yeah so yeah no that's it that's it he ran as an independent and he got it um and the fact is he went uh full uh uh on on on all the um Progressive policies so he endorsed minority rights both ethnic minority and sexual minorities he endorsed for example uh yeah all all the you know women's rights to abortion and he played a lot a lot on the youth card like he uh got a majority support uh from young people because this year this is it was a number like published a lot in Romanian media 1 million Romanian uh Romanian citizens now which are over 18 years of age voted for the first time so 1 million went went to vote for the first time which meant that he actually could gather that support from this this young voter base young Progressive voter base and he managed to pull I think like 350 around 350 um thousand votes so he managed that 3 1% pretty easily now yeah the one thing to mention before yeah this is the last thing about and so for now uh he was elected in 2019 on the union to save Romania which was from renew Europe and now he switched to the greens and became their vice president so formerly not bad renew Europe yeah formerly renew Europe okay moving on to your do you have any other winners or any losers that we still have to talk about that's part of this that we can put in your opinion one one quick one quick loser I think it's the third image which is cathaline drul the former leader of the Union to save Romania the renew Europe the biggest renew Europe Romanian party uh he quit uh as a as the leader of this party this party was mainly founded as on an liberal anti-corruption platform uh with people coming from the business environment with people coming from a lot of NOS so the civil Society being involved and they really um they really um got a lot of support from the population as a credible Progressive uh if not too Progressive so let's call it you know liberal as renew Europe um alternative to the to the classical big two parties to the p and the P um and um now they failed because they electorate their voter base has been broken up on one side the very Progressive ones have gone to Nikola they went to the green alternative and on the other hand as you can see there the last party 3.7 that was also a breakaway of uh the USR so what happened there was basically um both the ultra rightwing broke up into and the not you couldn't call it left wing but the progressives let's go them also broke up into two or three factions it's the more shameful for the USR the union sa Romania was this loss because they Allied themselves with two smaller parties you can see there the part mishara and the forre which uh didn't help them at all because these are a bit more conservative parties absolutely no below 10% uh in 2019 this is the last thing I'm mentioning I I'm speaking to that's fine I think it's it's fasc I mean even you even got a super chat from politics for fun thank you politics for fun great insights on Romania thanks Andy so I think the audience is enjoying it Andy so please finish what you were what you were about to say okay um yeah no the fact that in 2019 this party the union to save Romania got 22% of the vote right yeah so this is the big like this is a big down and that's why this guy cathaline drul which was the leader in the past or three years he just like one day after the election he he said he's resigning he's taking responsibility for the failure but he's resigning and now the basically the USR is looking for a new leader they don't know who yet yeah yeah yeah yeah um Andy this has been great um thank you so much so uh everyone in the chat um if you want to think thank Andy he he was great today I learned a lot about about Romania um we have his details in the in um in the description of the video so please check it all out he's as I mentioned he's very busy in for EU andu um and does a lot of the content there so officially you're the staff writer in the media Department right for EU and you Andy yeah no I am I'm I'm there I'm the deputy um of for video production in the media Department yeah thank you so much for having me you did a great you do a great job yeah it's been it's been great to have you thank you so much and um I'm sure hopefully we work again in the future together so I appreciate it and thank you so much byee bye thank you by so so before we go to our final guest today um any any other questions based on what we just talked about so I know there were some other ones he should have been okay so P pra Alexandro you mentioned he should have been more harsh with Aur and SOS well maybe our next guest can can can be a bit harsher on them and let me see if there's any other questions I should answer before we go to our next guest um let me have a look here Maxim fonder mer Maxim you asked me I don't know if this is already asked but what do you think is the future of Ukraine with the result of the elections is support going to Wayne moving forward uh it's it's a very good question but and and it depends on the on on the numbers right the Coalition being formed but I don't see it changing because the biggest parties are still EP here let me actually show you here these are the election results right and the the biggest parties are the EP here the blue and the red the snd and then we can even take renew Europe in there and already here we have 406 seats selected which is a majority of 45 so and all of these three big European groups are very Pro Ukraine right they want to support Ukraine and they see the Russian aggression as terrible obviously like why wouldn't you um so so no I don't see the report changing to be honest um yes the IND group who's most critical of Ukraine um they grew but they didn't grow enough to stop the support and even the ECR here the blues I marked here the ECR group it's another right-wing group a bit to the right of EP um they're very supportive of Ukraine that's Malone's party for those that uh that have questions on that anyway um yeah and yeah exactly and if you want to support our Channel I see I see Miguel is spamming the chat uh please do support the channel uh I mentioned already we have patreon please sign up to patreon help us out there send a Super Chat whatever you can as mentioned before we are independent and um appreciate the support that that we can get but without further Ado I would like to introduce our our next guest and again I'm G to try to pronounce the name correctly rares I think um should be should be correct but please correct me in a minute he's the uh he's going to be well he currently serves as the board member for the Youth Forum and he will become the president of the Youth Forum in on the 1 of July European Youth Forum um and rashu can explain a little bit exactly what that is because I think a lot of our viewers uh don't know what that is and also he's previously worked for Unicef in the field of Child and Adolescent engagement and support the participation of children in the decision-making process so that's uh without further Ado rares great to have you on the on the live stream today um yeah welcome to be here here I I'm happy you I'm happy you accepted our invitation yeah thank you so much lbert and fantastic pronunciation of my name I have to say one of the best I've ever heard in international context um so just to give a bit of um background information maybe on the European newth for we are the largest platform with you organizations in the world we bring together more than 100 youth organizations from all across Europe um both National Youth councils in the different European countries and international youth organizations uh among which also some of the um what we call party political Youth Organization so the youth Wings if you will of of the main European political um parties very very cool well well great great to have you on and and Rish where you from you're so I'm Romanian but I I live in the nether I live and I study in the nether perfect no it's it's really the Romania day today which I'm very happy about because I feel sometimes we we don't put enough emphasis on on uh on having well on covering Eastern European countries and it's it's great to have another person from Romania on um yeah so so let's Jimmy Mary I love it thank you so much for the Super Chat I will get to your question in a minute but before I answer your question I won't forget I promise let me first ask rares what did you think of the European elections what's your first thought you know about the results well for all of us at the for it was a bit of a nailbiter because we knew and we were expecting from the um polls that we were seeing before the election the opinion polls we were expecting arise of the far rights um now that we have the final results from almost all member states we're happy to see that the increase was there so it was as we expected it but it wasn't as high as we expected it to be so in that sense it was a bit of um you know sigh of relief but at the same time there was a pretty significant decrease so it's something we cannot ignore um and particularly for us what was very relevant was to look at um the voting intention of young people so we have data coming in right now as it's being um properly properly put together by the national electoral authorities we have the data on the voter turnout and we can understand a bit better also from the exit polls and everything as all that data is being aggregated we can understand a bit better what the the voting behavior of young people um was because in 2019 do you know already sorry R interrupt do you already know sort of what not or not yet are these results known yet of what the yeah okay go ahead sorry yeah it's it's it's somewhat um still preliminary but we knew in 2019 that a big part of you know the rise of the of the green parties as well was driven by young people because it was a very um the agend the agenda if I can say so of of young people in these organizations was very much focused on the climate crisis also um fueled by the um credits for future movement and so on now what we saw so I we have a few results coming out of that came out of of um of Germany uh and there we did see a an increase in the voting behavior of young people towards the far rights towards the afd far rights right yeah yeah but we also saw what's very interesting in Germany in particular we saw that young people also voted um more for smaller parties so not necessarily for very wellestablished uh parties like the CDU for example or the or the greens but also it was a bit of a more fragmented voting um targeted voting behavior then we also saw in Italy for the AG group between 18 and 30 years old was actually the the georgeon party was um that was maybe provisioned to be a a a winner for this group this age group I think the first three or four parties were um more left left parties so they weren't necessarily um to the right or or extremist parties or anti-european uh parties from the data that we have right now so all of this will be taken with a grain of salt but from the data that we have right now this is pretty much what we what we're seeing interesting so let me just summarize so I understood that correctly so yes the younger generation or people voted more for let's say farri parties so like the afd like you mentioned but the second learning that we can see from the preliminary data is that um a lot of young people also vote voted for smaller parties would you say vault is that a smaller party for you is that an example or is that already a big party I think I I have to to double check the data set but I think it was um because that was an information we had for Germany so I think it was specifically German party I don't think it was um was was parties that are already in the parliament or are reflected in the European political space already so it's more in terms of um an intention of voting to bring upand cominging political parties into the landscape if you will by giving them the vote and by inting them with the with the vote but then again I think if you put them all in perspective so if we take an average uh when it's when the data to put together that aage will be available what I think we will see is that the voting attention of young people as a sub AG group if you will is not that different from that of general population so I don't we don't see significant discrepancies apart from Germany that we saw that there was um a a clear increase by 11 percentual points percentage points I'm not mistaken but other than that I think we're going to see a pretty pretty stable um yeah Trend yeah yeah um we have a question in the chat uh that I want to get back to it's a bit related what we're talking about to right now but I think it be great we can both give our opinion on this so it's from Jimmy Mary thank you so much for the Super Chat and is asking here do you think ursa's power over the parliament will increase now that her party share have swollen so basically the EP just for everyone on the call you can see my screen um that's the ep the European people's party that is Ura under Lion's party so she is the lead candidate for them and they've grown by 14 seats as you can see here and maybe r do you have any any input on that do you think that her power has grown with this new election result or or not um I wouldn't be able to tell you Ian for us at the Youth Forum what we're looking more towards in the next in the upcoming month two month as the negotiations for new commission will take place is to understand a bit better where the topics that matter to young people are positioned on the new commission's agenda rather than um the presidents of the Commission in particular because we yeah go go ahead go we saw in the previous so yeah in the political program of the current um of the current College of Commissioners that there were quite a few you know ambitious goals that impact the lives of young people as well and in throughout the Mandate we also advocated and manage to quite few things on their agenda as well such as Banning unpaid internships um and ensuring that young people are fairly remunerated in all member states so I think for us it's more um it's going to be more of a Learning Journey as we go on to understand a bit better on these priorities that were worked on in the current Mandate of the commission and the current Parliament right for what will there be or for which of the topics will there be political will to carry them on to the next Parliament okay I have a question on that but before I I ask you the next question Rish let me just quickly answer my thoughts on Jimmy Mary's um question so do I think ura's power for the parliament will increase um remember five years ago um Jimmy um probably not pronouncing your name correctly there Jimmy Mary but remember five years ago Ursa only won the parliament by I think eight seats or so eight nine I might be a bit wrong there but very very narrow so you know that was already minimal and now the EP has grown which is great but she has Rebels with her own with within her own ranks right so very quickly I already mentioned it before but in France you have the Republicans they're unlikely to support ferine even though they're part of the EP group and there's others even in the CDU CSU yes they voted for her by majority but there might be Rebels here there too so she will need more than just the EP right so here if I sh if you see my screen you can see the social Democrats you see the renew group and you see the European party and that is majority of 45 but she likely will not um there likely will be more Rebels than 45 meaning that she will not have a majority with these three meaning that she has to lean on the greens or on the ECR so do I think her power of the parliament will increase I actually don't I actually don't think so because her friends like renew group renew group the yellow they've decreased in power so I think it's quite neutral and I think her biggest her biggest challenge will be uh passing the parliament vote to vote her into president in a couple of weeks but I can go in more detail after rares um if you want but we should now focus on on on you again R sorry about that um so you mentioned priorities for young people right do you have any insight what the priorities are of young people in the next five years do you have anything you could say around that do you have any research around that yeah so when we we've put together at the at the Youth Forum we've put together a Manifesto for the European Parliament elections uh that we've actually socialized with the European political parties we for some of them where we um were invited we took part in their congresses and we strongly advocated towards all of them to include the priorities from our Manifesto in their in their European manifestos some of them did the parties that of course have manifestos um and the way we've put together this um this this document so this Manifesto with the demands of the Youth Forum is through consultation with our member organizations that work and represent young people at the national and in different International contexts as well so we structured these demands in um more more or less three or four um clusters ranging from democracy so when it comes to access to rights and when it comes to young people actually having legally enshrined rights um spoke about a un convention um on on the rights of young people for which the next Parliament can be instrumental in terms of of political will developing a new youth test um so this really pertains a lot to how much young people have a say in European policymaking processes um because this is so you're trying to increase that I assume right you want younger people to have more and what what's a concrete idea like how can we involve them more well so this this proposal the European Union youth test as we called it is a proposal that we came up with in 2022 that was the European year of Youth if you remember um and it's basically a a test hence the name that is would be applied to all policies made in the European Union so to understand a bit better what the short medium long-term um impacts of that specific policy would be on young people and then to identify any potential negative effects and to mitigate them before the policy is approved so we've already done quite a bit of progress on this um the European economic and social committee has taken it up internally so they're already running the first um youth test the commission has already done one or two if I'm not mistaken as well so we're seeing a bit more mainstreaming of participation in uh in these decision making processes but what's very important to note as numbers as well is that in terms of political representation so actual representation of young people in politics at the end of this term of the European Parliament only two out of 705 members of the European Parliament are under 30 years old whereas 25% of the youth population um is is made up of young people so I think we also speak about this kind of representation and ensuring and it was part of our demands towards the the political parties to ensure that young people are in electable positions what do you think of the conference on the future of Europe so let me quickly explain what that was that was a couple years ago for everyone doesn't know where if correct me if I'm wrong Rish but a lot of young people all over Europe were able to go to the parliament right and present their ideas and things like that which I think was quite a cool initiative um is that something that we'll see again or do you know anything about that um yeah yeah so I I remember the the conference and it was a lengthier consultation process that had also National components and indeed it also had these citizens panels or citizens assemblies in uh in the European Parliament um our issue with that is that it's in a sense through the narrative it promoted by you know saying that it's see we're seeing with youth organizations as well sometimes that um the commission or the institutions or the parliament the European Union wants to reach out to unorganized citizens or unorganized young people that are not part of NOS or that are not um present in these processes through a representative um an organization for example and we feel that really undermines the importance of organized civil Society so sometimes these processes by selecting arbitrarily random more often than not citizens to come and take part without often times having a meaningful preparation you know as to what's going to happen or or how the price is going to look like our fear is that in that process it might have at times been a bit tokenistic now in terms of the outcomes of the conference I we we we know them we were part of some of the processes so it wasn't a complete exclusion of organized civil society which we were very happy about um yeah and conclusions of the conference are I mean they're very good in terms of political priorities and and moving forward now the only Gap that needs to be filled is between those conclusions actually making it in the political program of the next of the next Commission of the next five years that will be the tough one right um because I mean the commission is um is always debatable because they're very selected group within each other it' be great to have a little bit more input from the from uh from younger people that we have um yeah uh anything else uh rares a a a fun question to finish things off who is going to win the Euro Cup I must say I'm not I'm not a huge football fan you're football fan what not not really yeah I don't know I don't know um why that never stuck with me when I was growing up but um I know there's a there's a big match tonight right that much I know there are there multiple matches there there's loads of matches the European okay you need to get tonight specifically ah tonight there's three matches so I'm from the Netherlands and Netherlands just Lo just lost I keep saying lost they just won 21 um and now I can't remember let let chat let me know what the game is now I've got no idea who's playing now but tonight's England so that will be quite interesting okay I'm not sure who is going to win the Euro Cup but I I hope that the winners after this European par Parliament elections uh in terms of having their voices and the priorities present in the upcoming five years so in the Parliament and the commission will be the young people so I I'm not really a huge Authority on football but I can I can speak about um what matters to to us as U as young people okay and R I do have a political question for you because someone in the chat he wants to ask you a question yes or G Alexandre and okay so let me read it out and see if if you understand what is meant by this Rish will know so r will know but in Romania SOS and Aur are doing in the official time of the meeting in Parliament a big circus screaming bringing different objetive objects and costumes in order to disturb the ambience I guess um and now he's asking is that going to be is that going to happen in the European Parliament too or is this is this too detailed this question or do you have any ideas on that okay not the to I mean it's something that's we we saw and I mean it's it was very present social media coming out of Romania coming out of other can you explain what happened because I don't think I don't even know what happened what happened just it's just a general um well not General but this reoccurring Trend that we saw sometimes also in the parliament in Italy and in other parliaments across Europe when politicians often times having not pro pro-europeans or anti-european views or being a very extremist in their stances this very loud and very decisive in a sense but decisiveness more towards aggressiveness not towards yes this is what the citizens want um and just the the impact that has on social media the impact it has on Tik Tok for example we saw that in France as well with the with the rise of the the of RN of the far right party I am and we also saw that the truth be told we also saw that on different topics and in different parliamentary debates for those who maybe follow them we also start out in the European Parliament so I think right as long as the rules I mean I I'm not really not the authority on this topic but as long I was suppose as long as the rules of procedure of the um in Recons of the parliament are not infringed upon I suppose the the debate would be and the statements would be would be allowed but that's up to the president of the European Parliament so yeah yeah it's quite interesting because pra Alexandra wrote again and said they bring a bell screaming wake up when they talk about cutting the special pension subject so apparently they're quite vocal and and to be honest is some of the plenaries in the European Parliament man they're so boring so it we for us for us you know viewers or for for the channel it' be quite fun to see a bit of uh animation there so let's see what happens yeah also also be careful what we we should be careful what we wish [Laughter] for all right awesome um rares thank you so much for joining our live stream so again your Rish again rash's details are in our description as mentioned he's the president of the EUR or he will be the president of the European Youth Forum so make sure to check them out and um yeah a big thank you to you and hopefully we'll see you again soon in in a future live stream raes thanks a lot lus and thanks everyone for watching see you soon see you later all right okay so we're without guest again um it's just me alone which is fine um let's have another look at this list because I kind of want to finish this a little bit of how I think the future European Parliament could look like um we talked a lot with guests we got a lot of insights so so uh again here we have the eums predictions of the final Parliament we have the National Party results and I will go through one by one now until I don't know anymore because the small parties I do have a have a bit of a a lack of knowledge especially the one seater ones and um let's have a look at where they could end up so we have the afd talked about that fides talked about it five star movement so this is a very interesting case they don't really lean far Italians correct me if I'm wrong they don't really lean far right or far left they're more Center left I'd say and they have an interesting Concept in Italy where they try to use direct democracy right where people can vote directly in a digital interface Etc and um they haven't moved they haven't joined any of the groups before um at least not in the last five years I'm correct and um they I don't think they they might stay non aligned but they could also move to join BSW so to join buar I can see this and again Italians please disagree with them if you'd like to and um yeah and I'm going to put them into the new group number one for now so I think they are potentially someone that uh BSW could could uh form an alliance with now we talked about Confederation in the indd uh we talked about Aur potentially to the ECR that was our Romanian colleague that joined the call that mentioned that that is a possibility and then we have another one interesting one smme which is a left-wing uh coal leftwing more of a leftwing party um which F fito runs in um I'm Italian sorry I'm interrupted Jimmy Marian I'm an Italian the five star movement is a joke um thank you for the donation um please tell us in the chat why you think they're a joke and uh thank you for the donation and do you think they will join a new group or one of the existing ones also for now I will keep them in new group one I think SM is another potential new group candidate maybe with bag and the five star movement then we have Revival so this is in Bulgaria three seats they also have farri Tendencies and again if someone Bulgarian is in the chat let me know a bit more about them but if they were to join anyone I would see these in the [Music] IND then we have another far-right entity which is the party is over we talked about that earlier so they potentially could also join the indd group and then we have deai in Germany also goes leftwing I am not very familiar with them but if they were to join anyone it would probably be the snd or potentially also a new group you never you never know although working with I don't think so so let's keep that for non align for now and now the interesting one here I wanted to get to because I know there's lots of Vault viewers here and vault had a very very impressive election campaign right they had one um MEP Damen bager we had him on a live stream a week ago and they grew from one MEP from Germany to two MEPS from the Netherlands and three from Germany if I'm not mistaken so that is a total of uh five MEPS in in total so what like a 500% increase to what they what they had before um so that's quite impressive now they used to be aligned to the greens right but that was just one MEP and now they have a choice again to join renew Europe or to join the greens all five MEPS and I'll tell you one thing now that renew Europe as you can see is a lot smaller than it used to be they'll be fighting to get them on board um and the greens obviously will too because the greens lost a lot of seats so it be very very interesting to see where they go um so I will put them here at either renew Europe or the greens and depending how the 20,000 Volt or 20 or 30,000 volt uh members will vote we will see but let's for for fun put renew Europe here then we have the Communist Party of Greece so if they would join anyone then probably the left but I don't know enough about them and then we have the okay I'm going to going to completely butcher these words the faha and motorists this is a Czech party actually there's two Czech parties that formed a coalition together um and they I've talked to a Czech friend before this call and he mentioned that EP is a possibility for them uh but again it's not not not completely clear who they who they could or would like to join then there's loads of parties here below with one seat so let me know in the chat if uh if you got any ideas from your local country of where these MEPS could go to but having now gone through the big countries the European Parliament could potentially look like this and this is where it's very interesting because yes these two will remain the biggest the EP and the snd but renew Europe would also get a little bit bigger with Vault actually one second gu I need to switch this quick quickly I'll do that later don't worry about it okay doesn't matter um Ren Europe would also get a little bit bigger but the most impressive one is the indd group right which would get gets an additional 29 seats to 87 so really if these groups with these parties realign a little bit based on what I've done here in the uh in the in the Excel I andd could actually be the third biggest party in the European Parliament and I do not think it's unrealistic especially because the Leen is flirting with the IFD again which will be super interesting uh okay so let's go through some of the some of the questions now so first is a Super Chat by danus thank you so much danus for supporting the channel I really appreciate it so here we have Lithuania I think ltu is Lithuania I'm pretty sure tell me about wrong EBP three seats ECR is three seats snd two seats renew two seats greens so greens will lose one seat and two new seats will go to ECR So based on the results there again um we will have the ECR the right-wing Parliament getting stronger again if you would like do we have anything here from Lithuania we have them here so if you're if you can see now danis have a look you can see that this party here currently has one seat and is unaligned will they go anywhere special let let let me know in this in the chat all right then me go to Jimmy Mary another another Super Chat thank you again very much so I'll mention the most damning problem they are Putin stoes fstar movement aligned papers are filled with putini putini uh propaganda okay um interesting I I feel like quite a few parties in Europe have this problem I mean I wonder how they do it how do how they do this like how do they how do they get financed by Russia are they financed by Russia and Jimmy Mary do you have any like like sources around this I would love to know a bit more about uh about the five star movement and how they are related with uh with with Russia then the next chat uh we have BGC Von uh Revival Areo pseudo nationalist sorry kleptocrats that use Pro Russian votes they came off to their previous pro-russian party okay when I read these comments then I mean I don't think this is so unrealistic you know a new group one for five star movement uh because I mean bu is not exactly negative on on Russia either so I would keep them based on that comment in a new group one potentially and in terms of Revival I mean the indd again is not is not is not scared to shy away from uh from Pro Russian sentiment so I kept them in the in the & group all right any other comments let me read through them okay thank you Jimmy Mary I will look at the paper ilat cedano is that um is that in English that would be that would be great all right okay so basically what am I saying um we go back to the top here new group number one so at the moment I can only really see a new group being formed with these three parties so five star movement BSW and maybe even SM that would still not be nowhere near enough though so we would have three countries out of the seven needed and n 19 out of the 25 needed I also saw in the chat someone mentioned that the the the the minimum amount of MEPS needed is 24 so if I'm wrong here uh I'm sorry I'll I'll I'll have to correct this after after the call after the after the live stream awesome any further questions anyone soon we're going to have just just a little teaser soon in a couple minutes we're going to have the entire EU simple team on here and um and basically thank all of you for the uh for the for the amazing support you've given us right to uh to hit the 100,000 subscribers so definitely stick around for a bit so you can get to know all of us it's not just me lambertus we actually do have a team behind all of this but if you do have any more questions or anything you want to like um yeah talk about please mention in the chat uh let's have a look if I can see any more questions so yeah I can see another comment that we need that's only 23 MPS not 25 so I apologize for that ah oh yeah I thought I remember a question earlier around France the elections whether this will backfire on macron so I made a video on this earlier this week um and the way I saw it is there's two reasons why he did it reason number one could be that it's literally he thinks he can win right he thinks that if it really becomes a choice between either um Leen which is what they label far right and well not Leen basically him in that in that sense that many people would flock away from the far right option and go for more for a more Centrist approach um that so maybe maybe he really does think that in the next month he can convince people also because of short notice and etc etc etc I just don't think I I don't know I think it's very very naive if that is his his reasoning the second option would be that I also mentioned in the video is that he kind of wants Le pent to win right so that he would like the far right to get a majority so that when they do or at least be in control so when they do that they mess up over the next two years it's no secret that um people that are in power are normally less popular so those are the two options why and I think it's backfired yeah I I really don't see this as a happy ending really I mean you can already see the left are making a coalition against the far right um you've seen the Republicans in France flirting with Leen um that was their leader he mentioned he'd be open to work with Leen um okay he's been fired and many in the Republicans don't want to be working with Leen or at least not sure he's been fired don't quote me on that but he definitely has issues within his own party um but yeah you can see two two massive groups forming the left who are uniting on the left the right you have Leen in the middle you've got macron right with his 18% support in the polls so yeah I see this a big problem I I I really don't know how he wants to turn this around um so yeah I guess out of the two options I presented maybe option two have someone else take power for the next two years hope that it fails maybe with his help you know support the failure a little bit more as president and um yeah see where we go from there ah okay thank you very much BGC veteran it is 25 M MEPS according to the European Parliament okay another question from stur modler do you think this election will change anything big good question um I mean again if you look at the parliament right how much has really changed like let's be blatantly honest about this 14 seats for the EP yeah that that is quite a bit right which is great um and 22 seats lost in renew and 19 in the greens so what could change when you hear this well what do the greens stand for greens stand for environment they stand for green policies climate change so I do think that in the next Parliament we could have a little bit less of that right but then again the Socialist socialist and Democrats they're very strong on climate change so don't expect it to Disappear Completely there will still be climate policy um next thing renew lost a lot of seed so who's renew renew is macron let's be honest macron's the biggest player within renew what does renew stand for they stand for much more integrated EU right a Much More Much More in defense um things like that so maybe we will see a little bit less EU integration maybe but then again the EP is also supporting EU integration in some extent renew goes a bit further they want to abolish The veto the European people's party does not want to well they're unclear on it they don't specifically State whether they want to remove the veto so there could be a little bit less EU integration maybe over the next five years so for example those that watch my videos there's an EU reform um proposals making it through the parliament I want about removing the veto things like that I wonder if that will be able to to be implemented now that uh renew Europe has got such less support but again I really am no expert we need to see what happens the next coming weeks in terms of coalitions all right let me look at more questions the name of the festar newspaper is the daily fact in English and I'd suggest you look at the idea the Ide at the ideas of the director called tro okay I'll note it down I would love to learn a bit more about them yeah all right so Damon question from you do you think the influence that was voted into the European Parliament from Cyprus will do anything he mainly does 24-hour challenges and those kind of things Damon I'm gonna be honest with you I do not know him so interesting comment I'm going to look him up after the call and maybe we can talk about him in a future uh live stream so I think the eate simple team is coming online quite soon but while I'm waiting let's have a look at there's any other comments there's a nice site where you can see the possible proposed groups Europe elects awesome Andre thank you very much then I don't have to create all of these excels myself so we can do it a bit more efficient so I can see people are starting to come into the the call the eade simple team so let's give them a minute so they're all here any other questions all right so mastoras also fedas from Cyprus will either join a new Coalition or a new or the greens okay okay so that's this one here I assume well we'll have to we'll have to see right I can join them in Ren for now just to make it make a bit more fun anyway I'm not sure can can people see the team already um Elliot yes ah perfect okay everyone um I think you can see the first faces of the em8 simple team so it's uh it's great to uh to finally have face reveals to everyone here of who we actually are uh we're still a

and uh it was it was very nice all the speakers and everything and hopefully all of you guys are having fun as well um obviously we tried to make it as simple as possible so um the Excel sheet that lambertus has makes it very simple in that regard but yes yeah yeah we tried to we tried to I'm not sure how simple it really was but we can we can definitely tell you from the script writing side there are a lot of interesting videos that are going to be coming out in the next couple of weeks and months and years of course uh namely right now we're looking well we're going to see what the European Parliament composition is going to be what the new commission is going to be so there's a lot about that and then we're also gonna restart some other series but I'm not going to reveal much

uh Portuguese Channel opening hopefully to really trying to get to more local people so uh who who don't really like English that much you know what I mean to really try and uh get people to get more involved in in EU politics and I mean Miguel maybe you want to talk about social media because there's also more people working in that department that maybe deserve a shout out here yeah of course a shout out to to rasvan I think he couldn't be here today because he he's having a family day Sunday and also Lucas um Lucas is from Austria but he's Austrian Brazil Ilan uh and he's also helping with a social media team for now so so those are the two the two guys that I wanted to shout out for for their how many how many nationalities do we have on the call here like six five right yeah see like that look at that I don't think we have one National actually it's not true Elliot we're both Dutch yeah yeah because I don't think picked me up the last time can the stream hear Elliot can can we get a quick we like this short delay I think but let's see maybe it's even too loud or not too loud um because I've used the microphone before on the stream so yeah well we waiting waiting anyone here Elliott while while while waiting for the answer there is a question here no they can't hear you Elli got a lot quieter apparently yeah so get get your mouth to your mic man okay I can I can do it like this I think okay I I could hear you on the live stream by the way I was just trying to but the delay is a bit annoying but I can hear you okay but people are in chat are saying no anyways last time better sound yeah okay let me put up a little bit okay like this right this should be fine you know it's just real quick uh I mean I'm only like very small part Dutch anyways I'm I'm also part Belgian and Lithuanian so I'm I'm I'm very mixed as well so we got we got every every nationality represented here very good very good yeah yeah I mean the funny thing is I'm from the Netherlands but I've never lived there I mean I speak Dutch but that's that's it that's it um we have are you on B then yeah good question good question i' I I don't know I'm a proper EU citizen because I I've taken full advantage of Crossing Borders like like after a couple years live there then live live somewhere else because man Europe is so beautiful man like living on one city the whole time is almost almost a bit of a shame if you ask me yeah um we yeah fa we have a question why don't you ask this one will we eventually get a Dutch EU Made Simple Channel well i' really like to um I will not be the one who does that even though I speak Dutch too but uh I'm actually Belgian um I speak uh Dutch I've been there for a while also but I'm not a native and and uh we prefer to have native speakers for the different sub channels um I know a couple people but there would be Dutch speaking belgians which is maybe not the intention I don't know maybe we could do that also one day uh maybe flish right I would yeah maybe Flemish why not I mean everything is open uh but certainly not me but hopefully one day yeah awesome yeah then we have another question from and people ask question now is the time anything you want to ask go at e simple ask us also if you want to ask someone specific um we're kind of we need to be better mood guys it's 100,000 subscribers come on yes let's go yeah now it's the time to ask any questions specifically about the Made Simple future present past anything and we still waiting for a speech lambertus you need to do a speech a speech of course oh man man okay I I need to get a drink for that man I to get like a glass of glass of wine or something yeah um yeah I will I will I will have my big moment in a second I'll just answer Buddy's question why do you promote the EU for free shouldn't they subsidize EU simple or is it about staying independent it's a very good question um and um why I promote the EU for free is because I mean how can I say this shortly I think the EU we won't hide our bias we think I think the EU and I think all of us here in the call think so is an important part of Europe an important entity um why because we're not alone in the world and the national countries are too small so yes we definitely lean Pro euu just you know just to make it clear um but we try to present everything as neutrally as as as possible um and why did I why why are we staying independent or not like being sponsored by the EU or anything like that well because we don't want to have an influenced opinion right so we try to really keep by ourselves some videos will have a sponsor in it and I always clearly mention in the video I know I've received some hate from from some of people in the comments maybe here about some of the sponsors I've had and I do apologize about that if I chose like a sponsor that wasn't that great but we clearly mentioned when a video is sponsored but that video will still remain independent it's not influenced the content in that video by our sponsor it's just so that we can stay afloat because we're all spending a lot of time on the EU all of us in the call and um we need we need to be supported so again please no I think you muted yourself now my headphones just died oh okay I see that's the problem can can you still hear me though yes we can hear you per we can good good lamberto someone in the chat asks you what made you start this journey um I started because of brexit um I have a lot of English friends and I had so many arguments with them on brexit and why it would be a good thing or why it could be a bad thing and I noticed when I asked uh talked about the commission they didn't even know what the commission was um because it just so complex right or when I asked about the European Parliament there was little knowledge there so I thought of instead of explaining it for the fifth time because I'm a nerd and I read so much about it I just create a video um and then literally made it public and you guys started watching it so thank you thank you for watching it um because that started us on this whole journey and me in the start I had a couple friends and my mom watching now we have we have you know almost 300 people here in the live stream so amazing thank you thank you very much another question will you show your YouTube play button when you receive it 100% yeah definitely definitely probably in a live stream our are YouTube play button guys it's not I'm not alone anymore it's all of us and I'm happy it is all of us are we got rotate it yeah rotate okay yeah that's good great great idea great idea um so I think make it something like the Olympic flag you know has to go through every country or something yeah yeah oh sorry I have to answer on this Ana it was funny when you made a video about stopping the Russian Ukraine war and then then had a game where you I well sorry let me read that properly it was funny when you made a video about stopping the Russian Ukrainian war and then had a game where you create World War II yes that wasn't very sensitive I know and I do apologize for that but we had a debate in the team actually about this should we do it should we not we were short on or I was short on sponsors and um you're right it wasn't it wasn't the best integration at the end but um I happy you forgave us nonetheless um especially the problem is last excuse the problem was also I kind of already accepted the sponsorship and everything and then I realized when I inserted it that there was World War II everywhere as branding over it which wasn't great so uh yeah we'll work on that in the future any any questions for the rest of the team let's have a look maybe I can give so yakim are we going to make a EU made even more complex well I mean that is a very good question that you as it is is already very complex uh and I mean our aim here is to deliver the most relevant and the most important information in a very simple way as much as we can so I feel like it would potentially kind of defeat the purpose but I do know that there's a group of Watchers myself included who really want like in-depth analysis they really want like detailed information about basically anything so maybe instead of making a channel maybe we might make some more complex videos on some more complex topics but that is once again yet to be discussed especially because now the main focus is seeing how the European elections I mean they've already finished so now the construction of the European Parliament the commission and so on but maybe for a future series perhaps I I might have a I might have an idea for that y um there are some there are some talks in the background going for a potential uh e made simple podcast and on the contrary would not be eot made simple but maybe explore a bit more of the in-depth themes of uh topics that we handle in the videos so who knows maybe that's coming soon definitely yeah another format could be also be nice yeah yeah and let us know you're interest right we're try also trying this live stream approach too now um which is new for us and we try to get into a bit more detail so if this is things that you're interested in our our viewers then yeah let let us know uh we we were happy to you know also do what you guys want to see anyway um I see a mention from juggle junk nice name um at me um he asked in Dutch if I need someone who would like to do the Dutch Channel and he'd be interested to help us out um comment in here if there's people that would like to help the team very open I mean we are looking to to to to expand in certain areas and if you think you have a skill that we could could use for example a Dutch Channel email us um you can find the email address on our page give us an email let us know what you're interested in and we can talk no promises of course but we we want to expand we want to make EU the go-to brand for the EU that's the whole idea behind this so get involved all right so more questions some content questions can you make a video about the Belgian elections there's a lot we would love to if we are bigger uh I mean bigger if our team grows we're also able to cover more content right at the moment the Belgian election is on our list but I'm not sure if we'll get to it on time because the topic is already quite old right it's a week old already so if we have the time we will but it's difficult with a small team that we have um yeah maybe another announcement why not we're 100,000 strong now we have another announcement so these are my big speech uh Elliot no no it's actually not a big speech it's just announcing stuff so um we are trying to uh we're going to launch a merch store too so we're really thinking of cool ideas of what you might be interested um to well purchase I guess um so if you have any ideas or or or thoughts of what you think would be cool merch for us to use um let us know we're thinking of like t-shirts maybe with some cool EU types of slogans and things like that so if you have a cool EU slogan maybe making fun of the bureaucracy or whatever let us know um we could copy right at you on that on that t-shirt you know um so things like that we're really thinking of launching that we've launched we're going to relaunch patreon completely so we really want patreon to be worth it for you that you get additional content get additional levels that you get something for the yeah money that you give us right so if you're really interested in more content being more involved with us patreon is the place is the place to do it and um it's very important for us I I know I'm asking a third time for patreon but it's very important us because it keeps us afloat so please consider it um third thing going forward is the big Vision not my speech Elliot the big Vision um with all of these sub channels is that we have 24 eventually we have the main English Channel where all the main content will be released upon everything so if you follow the English Channel you're you're good but we also want to create 24 language channels underneath it so over the next two years or so we would love to cover all the European languages because we really want to get to people that are locally based so and that's why for the call because he's already started the French Channel yeah anything else um I think someone I think some people are voting are are asking about the um the Excel sheet that you used for the uh results and to make uh I guess maybe not uh Coalition but it's more of a result Builder if this is going to be public or no yeah yeah good question if you're interested in using this yourself I will put a link in the description of the stream bear with us I will do this after this call and um you can create your copy and you can play around as you want to uh I created it myself so it's not something I found online it's basically um yeah yeah I I created it yeah all right I can help you with the Swedish Channel love it Ana oh yeah Ana I think you asked us earlier too about covering the Nordic results apologies we didn't get to it um we will in the future and if you want to help with the Swedish Channel drop us an email um and we can talk if anyone else if you if anyone on fabis Miguel and yakim and Elliot right I I don't want to be talking only so if you see a question jump in and you can ask that too yeah I I have one I haven't seen that Exel before so um maybe you already explained it but um can you just walk me through on a high high level to see if I would play with that later yeah yeah sure so basically what I was trying to do is show or or make it simple to see how the seats would change if a certain party that is nonaligned so not aligned to a European group were to join a European group so really what it is here below if you remove the filter and everyone on the call you can see clear uh select all sorry so then what you have you have a m oh any filters on here one second clear I think I need to refresh can you see my screen yeah we can can everyone see the screen in the Stream also yes they can although no no longer the the webcams all of them at least okay then let me select all yeah now it works sorry it wasn't working so basically here in the National Party results you have all the parties in Europe uh that we have that got seats sorry not all the parties but parties that have seats and all of basically all of these are summed up to this Overview at the top the European Parliament composition and also the predictions so what happens is if you change for example here for the CDU and this is what you change you change it to the greens you'll see them leave the EP and go to the greens right and that way you can play around really with well what kind of whatever composition in the European Parliament you think could happen and it's really cool so um I mean I'm I'm proud of it so use it if you want to um so yeah I'll gladly put that available any more thanks yeah uh Jimmy Mary I'm going to call you out again you gave so many tips today thank you so I see a question from you here what's your opinion on the formation of a European unified armor with nuclear capabilities right okay so this is very opinionated right um I definitely I'm gonna I definitely think the EU so I very clear my videos I've always said there are certain things in foreign policy like the veto vote that need to be removed so um because or need to removed that we think should be removed as it's holding Europe back but a full European Army I would I don't think we have an opinion on that I mean that's taking integration to to like the next level but I definitely think more integration in defense does make sense because we're losing a lot of money now just everyone spending nationally anyway any other questions when's the check yakim when is the Czech Channel coming my friend you're you're from Czech here aren't you yeah I mean technically the good thing about that is we can group it together with the sloak channel uh depending on what the viewers prefer because as a check I can go to speak fluent Czech they understand me I understand them so and it's very common that we just like interchangeably use these languages at least like how we speak so it's definitely I mean technically vend and be would only be 20 free language channels if we decide to go with that um it's realistic uh but as soon as I have a bit more time uh then I will definitely uh potentially look into it because that's something that I would personally be interested in doing so it may happen in the near future and it might be grouped together with the Slovak Channel and Elliot what do you think a video about euro coins about about the the coins as in all of the different currencies or as in the on the Euro I assume the different Euro you know you can explain hey that's a good idea actually all the euros and explain what the little sign is on them the little whatever yeah yeah why not I mean I so I I can say why not because I am not the one responsible for creating the video so say so I would say go ahead and make any video that you would like but uh it's more more up to you for the feasibility I guess team eort Elliot team effort team effort yeah that's true yeah I I I think the um the cool thing about the the different amount of channels that we're building up here is that I mean everyone um from their respective EU member states they really want to see a uh or more information about their country right that makes sense but in within the context of the European Union I feel like that could maybe also play a big role in these more um like language focused channels so the French channel would have maybe a bit more uh French content in that regard I guess yeah yeah it's a very good point Elliot I mean we can always go for like a confederal model right like where we have the at the top we have the English videos and the local channels could potentially also have some more localized content who knows yeah it's a good idea I saw another question here and I I I I would like to point this out and I know it's content again so Villa I know you asked me on Discord too ah everyone can join our Discord it's a great Community where everyone like has great conversations Villa here on on or on the chat here is part of the the Discord and he asked he also asked some Discord so I'm going to answer it I wanted to ask about the current state of treaty reform and if there will be a part four video on updating us and the convention answer is yes there will be a video on this when we know more when will we know more it's hard to say earliest I'd say end of this month because then the leaders of the European Union meet but it could be later it's not a priority at the moment the priority is the commission president and the European Council president things like that all right awesome um Yak we got a question for you that's a good question yeah I was gonna say I was just looking at it so the question is yakim what is the cheapest beer in your town is water still more expensive um so that is a very good question I think that what specifically makes the beer like deeper compared to Western European Alternatives is the fact that we do not use the euro and we also we the fact that we have our own currency also means that our wages are just like lower so if a Western European were to come into Prague they could easily get like quality tap beer for like like a pint for like two50 which sometimes there's places in restaurants where you cannot even get water in Western Europe so that's kind of a reality here but for checks €250 is already EXP expensive for big beer because obviously our wages are not as big so there definitely are places where technically beer is still cheaper than water I'm not necessarily referring to Taps but if you go to a grocery store you can definitely get beer for like I don't know 40 cents a bottle 30 cents a bottle even less potentially um but in a restaurant I don't believe so so tap would probably work yeah as I said AED about 2 to 250 maybe a bit more and water is yeah usually around just under two like a small one um but obviously yeah this is a question that we as checks not just me personally but as checks we get asked quite a lot but long story short if you're coming from Western Europe and you're paid a Western European wage then you're going to have a Time of Your Life in Czech Republic if you love beer though that's the long story short very nice all right yeah I feel I have to pick in on that one because it's about beer uh really interesting I've um I've only been uh once in that part of of of Europe but um it's a long time ago I didn't really drink that much back then not that I do that today neither actually pretty much not um but yeah um I'm uh I'm living in Brussels at the moment and um I'm certainly not speaking for all my fellow compatriots but my experience in this town is that uh uh we've got a large range of uh of beers uh different kinds of beers and that goes also for the price but uh the pretty much standard beer would go here between I would say two and four Euros depending on the place you are and depending on the touristic aspect of it but it can go as high as 8 EUR or something if you go for special beers and depending on the place uh well it can get real expensive so yes it's really interesting plus we have the Euro so yeah awesome right specific we got one more question here from Abigail so that way with Ireland specific in the ah okay yes I think it probably would I mean what what language would you like to see for the Irish Channel or I mean yeah because I mean most people in Ireland speak English so I think that would save us a lot of time so yeah anyway um I think we can call it there right I mean any anything else from the team no then thank you everyone uh again it
