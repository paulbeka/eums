    "transcription": "Romania has just wrapped up the first \nround of its presidential elections,   where citizens had the chance to choose \nfrom a field of over ten candidates. Out   of this crowded lineup of 13 candidates, five \ncontenders stood out as the most popular,   with one emerging as the clear front-runner. \nBut the journey isn’t over yet—Romania’s   presidential elections are a two-round process, \nmeaning the decisive battle is still ahead.  In the Romanian electoral system, eligible \nvoters across the country cast their ballots   for their preferred candidate in the first round. \nIf no candidate secures an outright majority—over   50% of the votes—the top two contenders move \non to a decisive second round. This runoff,   scheduled to take place in two weeks, calls \non voters to return to the polls for a direct,   head-to-head contest. It’s this final showdown \nthat ultimately determines who will lead the   nation as its next president.\nSo, who won?  Romanian ultranationalist Călin \nGeorgescu has claimed victory in the   presidential race, with the most votes.\nReformist candidate Elena Lasconi came   in second, very very narrowly edging out \ncentre-left Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu,   in third. In fourth came another Hard-right \ncontender George Simion followed, followed   by Nicolae Ciucă in fifth place.\nThis means no single candidate   secured over 50% of the vote, so the top \ntwo candidates, Georgescu and Lasconi,   will face off in a runoff election in two weeks.\nGeorgescu’s surge has shocked many—especially   since pre-election polls didn’t even \nrank him in the top three. His rise is   widely attributed to his strategic use of TikTok, \nwhich helped him rally unexpected voter support.  Known for his extremely religious \nand ultranationalist views,   Georgescu’s platform emphasises reducing Romania’s \nreliance on imports, supporting local farmers,   and boosting domestic food and energy production. \nBut his campaign hasn’t been without controversy.  He’s faced criticism for praising Romania’s \n20th-century fascist movement. He has also   argued that the EU and NATO do not properly \nrepresent Romanian interests, and claimed   Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Romanian neighbour, \nis manipulated by American military companies.  The race for second place was fiercely \ncontested, keeping everyone on edge   throughout the night, including us!\nEarly polls placed Elena Lasconi,   representing the center-right USR party, \nfirmly in third place. However, as votes   from the diaspora and Bucharest were tallied, \nLasconi surged ahead, overtaking third-place   contender Marcel Ciolacu Marchel Cholacu by a \nsuper narrow margin. At the time of recording,   only a handful of votes separated the two.\nLasconi has made her mark as a strong advocate   for deeper EU and NATO integration, \nsolidifying her position as a pro-EU,   pro-Western voice in Romanian politics. \nLocally, she’s known for her unwavering   stance on anti-corruption and her ability to \nconnect with people across the political spectrum.  Her journey into politics is just as \ncompelling. A former journalist and reporter,   Lasconi transitioned to public service in 2020 \nwhen she became the mayor of a small town in   southern Romania. Now, as the leader of the Save \nRomania Union (USR), a liberal center-right party,   she champions reform, transparency, \nand a commitment to European values. In a disappointing third place is Marcel \nCiolacu, leader of the PSD (Social Democratic   Party) and Romania’s current Prime Minister. \nKnown for his pro-EU and pro-NATO stance,   Ciolacu positions himself as a champion \nof Romania’s Western commitments. However,   his career has been shadowed by \ncontroversy and accusations of corruption.  One major scandal links him to figures connected \nto Nordis, a real estate company accused of   running a Ponzi-like scheme that defrauded \nthousands of inves tors. Allegations suggest   that Ciolacu even took a private flight \nwith individuals tied to the scandal,   raising serious concerns about his associations. \nDespite this, his position as Prime Minister and   PSD’s promises of social welfare and economic \nstability have secured him a loyal voter base.   Still, for many, his result reflects ongoing \nfrustrations with corruption in Romanian politics.  In fourth place is George Simion, leader of the \nfar-right AUR party. Simion is best known for his   unionist vision, advocating for the unification \nof Romania and Moldova, and for his combative,   often inflammatory style in Romanian politics.\nFalling to fifth place is Nicolae Ciucă,   representing the center-right PNL party. This \nresult is a significant blow to the party,   as Ciucă hails from the same political \ncamp as outgoing President Klaus Iohannis,   who is stepping down after two terms in office.\nThese candidates have missed their shot at the   presidency and will not advance to \nthe runoff election in two weeks.   The stage is now set for the final showdown \nbetween Călin Georgescu and Elena Lasconi.  So, what does the presidency in Romania mean? \nIn Romania’s semi-presidential system, the   president shares power with the Prime Minister and \nParliament but still plays a key leadership role.  As head of state, the president represents \nRomania internationally, oversees foreign policy,   leads the armed forces, and influences national \nsecurity. Domestically, they appoint the Prime   Minister (with Parliament’s approval), \ncan send laws back for re-evaluation, and   shape the judiciary by appointing 3 top judges.\nSo, one of these two personalities will assume   this position, as Romanians will make their final \ndecision in two weeks on December 8. Additionally,   Romania is gearing up for parliamentary elections \nnext weekend on December 1. The nation is fully   immersed in election season, and we'll be covering \nthese events in upcoming videos.
