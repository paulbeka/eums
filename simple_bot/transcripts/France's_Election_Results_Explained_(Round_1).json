And let's face it,   for the second time within a month, it's bad \nnews for the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But bear in mind that these are not presidential \nelections, but parliamentary, meaning that Macron   will stay until 2027 as planned. But before \nwe dive into the results, let's explore   how elections in France actually work and why \nthere are two rounds with two different dates. France uses a system called the “two-round \nsystem,” with candidates divided based on   their constituencies. In the \nfirst round, on June 30th,   citizens vote for the candidates and their \nrespective parties in their constituencies.   There are two possible outcomes in the \nfirst round: either a single candidate   receives 50% or more of the votes, or none \nof the candidates reaches this threshold. If a candidate receives 50% or more, they \nautomatically become a member of the National   Assembly, a result known as an absolute majority \nvote. In this case there will be no second round. If no candidate achieves \n50%, which is more common,   a second round is held on July 7th, \nwhere the top two candidates face off. To qualify for this second round, both candidates   need at least 12.5% of the eligible \nvoter share in their constituency. In the second round, people vote again,   and the winner wins the constituency and \nsecures the seat in the parliament. The   example on the screen shows 3 parties in the \nrun-off, but more common is to see only 2. There are 577 constituencies, meaning 577 seats; \nthus, 289 seats are required for a majority. So, what do the first round results look like? In terms of percentages: In fourth place with 7% of the \nvote, we have the Republicans,   who stand for traditional conservative \nvalues, emphasising economic liberalism,   reduced government intervention, and \nstrong national security policies. In third place with 21% of the vote, we \nhave Macron’s Centrist Ensemble, who stand   for pro-European Union policies, economic reforms \naimed at boosting competitiveness and innovation,   and a progressive social agenda that \nincludes environmental sustainability. In second place with 28% of the vote, we have \nthe Left-Wing New Popular Front (NFP). The NFP   is a broad left-wing alliance created as \nthe successor to the New Ecological and   Social People’s Union (NUPES). It is \ncomposed of various smaller socialist,   communist, and green parties. The NFP stands for \nsocial justice, environmental sustainability,   increased social welfare programs, \nand reducing economic inequality. And in first place with 34% of the vote, Le Pen’s \nand Bardella’s National Rally plus their allies,   who stand for nationalist and \nanti-immigration policies,   prioritising French sovereignty \nover EU integration, advocating for   strict law and order measures, and economic \nprotectionism to support French businesses. In terms of percentages, Le Pen \nand Bardella’s National Rally   won the first round of the elections. However,   it is not that simple. So far, only a \nhandful of constituencies have been decided. At the time of recording: 38 seats have been secured for \nthe National Rally and Allies.  32 seats have been secured for the NFP.  And only 2 seats have been \nsecured for Macron’s party.  The Republicans secured 1, \nwith 3 seats going elsewhere. This means that 87% of the total available \nseats are still up for grabs this Sunday when   we enter the second round. In other words, \nfor 501 seats, no single party secured 50%,   and we are going into a runoff. We will create \na video on this, so make sure you subscribe. So, it might look like Le Pen and \nBardella’s National Rally are on a   path to a parliamentary majority, but this \nis not set in stone yet. They are indeed in   their strongest position ever, but several \nfactors could influence the final outcome. In the two-round system of French elections, \nthe cordon sanitaire often comes into play in   the second round. For example, If a far-right \ncandidate makes it to the runoff + 2 other   candidates, mainstream parties may withdraw \ntheir candidates or endorse each other to   consolidate votes against the far-right \ncandidate. This has already happened,   with both Macron’s and Melenchon’s parties \nsaying they would remove their candidate if   they are in third place in a constituency \nwhere the far right is currently first. Additionally, strategic voting plays a \nsignificant role. Voters from different   political backgrounds may be encouraged \nto vote for a less preferred mainstream   candidate to block the far-right candidate. \nFor example, left-wing voters might support   a centre-right candidate in the second round \nif the alternative is a far-right victory. So what will happen? Well, we see 2 scenarios: First, come Sunday the National Rally (NR) \nsecures at least 289 seats, achieving an   absolute majority in the National Assembly. \nIn this case, Jordan Bardella would become   the Prime Minister. This scenario would result \nin \"cohabitation,\" where the President and the   Prime Minister come from different political \nparties. Cohabitation can lead to political   tension and policy gridlock as the executive and \nlegislative branches may have conflicting agendas. Second, come Sunday, no French party secures \nan absolute majority. Even if the National   Rally wins the most seats, the National \nRally’s candidate for Prime Minister,   Jordan Bardella, has already stated \nthat he won’t be Prime Minister without   an obsolete majority. This would mean 2 \noptions, scenario 2a and 2b if you will. Macron’s Renaissance party is able to form an \nanti-Far Right block together with the NFP,   or part of the NFP, OR the Republicans. \nOr, no ruling coalition is formed,   France could face a governmental \ndeadlock. This unprecedented situation   would complicate the implementation \nof major reforms for at least a year,   as new legislative elections cannot be \ncalled to resolve the impasse until then. French viewers and others, we would love to \nhear from you. Thank you to our contributors   and Thank you so much for watching!
