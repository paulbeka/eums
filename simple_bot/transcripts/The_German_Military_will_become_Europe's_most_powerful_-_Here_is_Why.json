    "transcription": "fighter jets and helicopters that don't fly standard issue assault rifles that don't shoot straight and shortages in ammunition boots and even underwear during a nato mission in lithuania these are the headlines that the ones feared german military are currently making not to mention the hundreds of millions of euros that went to consultants in an effort to clean up the army's mess with very little to show for it german high-ranking officials are raising their concerns and so are nato allies where statements such as these are not uncommon ever since the cold war ended in 1991 germany has allowed its military to deteriorate and this is somewhat understandable as germany was busy integrating the west with the east which posed great economic and social challenges over the last 30 years there was simply very little incentive to have a powerful military as germany doesn't share a border with potential aggressors like russia nato and especially the us was there for protection and unlike the us and the uk germany had very few overseas commitments and there was very little appetite for a large military among the population who still remember the horrors of world war ii but now overnight everything has changed only three days after the russian invasion of ukraine the german chancellor olaf schultz made a shocking announcement declaring that germany will massively increase its defense spending and meet the 2 nato benchmark this was met by applause in parliament and surveys already show that 75 of germans support this decision but how significant is this increase let's have a look at defence spending across the globe last year in 2021 as you can see germany spent 52.8 billion dollars sitting at seventh in the world ranking list slightly ahead of france but significantly behind the uk and russia but if we compare percentage of gdp germany ranks much lower of the 20 biggest military spenders germany comes in 15th as they only spend 1.4 percent of their gdp on their army many have criticized this lack of spending as it is far below the nato target of two percent however once germany hits the two percent target things will look very different because of germany's strong economy military expenditure would rise to 76.12 billion dollars putting germany into third place ahead of russia and the uk making them the front runner within the eu and europe by quite some distance and german politicians have said as much clearly stating that this is the intent and it doesn't stop here in an effort to modernize the military more quickly all of schultz has also dedicated a one-time special fund of over 100 billion euros to german defense this is a lot of money but spend doesn't necessarily equal military might the uk france and russia are still far ahead when it comes to military strength here we can see the comparison between these nations while germany does have a significant number of soldiers aircraft and tanks it only has a very small presence on the sea france and the uk do have a considerable navy with multiple destroyers submarines and even three aircraft carriers in between them and well then there's russia who just has a lot of everything as for nuclear weapons in the aftermath of world war ii it was agreed that germany cannot possess nuclear biological or chemical weapons however this comparison is somewhat incomplete and flawed as it does not take into account military modernization high-tech weapons logistics military experience and intelligence whether germany will become a military superpower also depends on how the money is spent schultz has already hinted at a high-level tech wish list such as the f-35 fighter to replace older tornado aircraft from the 1970s the future combat air system which is developing together with france heavy transport helicopters modernization of air defense missile systems armed drones modern warships etc however as mentioned at the start of the video germany still seems to be getting the basics wrong only around 40 percent of helicopters and 65 of tanks are operational and it gets even worse a recent german parliamentary report found that only 50 percent of major military hardware is working properly therefore money needs to be spent in getting existing equipment up and running first and as you may remember from the start of the video the german bundeswehr has the reputation of wasting taxpayers money so will germany become the new european superpower possibly but not until germany cleans up its current mess and invests the new budget wisely but next to the world superpowers such as the us and china even with germany's new budget it remains a small player as it spends way too little and this really raises the question does an eu army make sense check out the videos below to see the reasons for and against an eu army and if you enjoy the content please subscribe and like the video i'm a very new channel and this will really help me grow you"
