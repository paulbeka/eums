    "transcription": "[Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen I hope you've been enjoying the sweet smooth jazz music going on in the background how are you all doing this is EU happy hour the only show uh that discusses the intricacies of EU politics with a beer isn't that right lombera my co-host cheers hi Elliot I I love the introduction by the way I love how you mentioned we're the only show covering the intes of the EU with a beer with a beer with a beer with a beer that is true with a beer you're probably right you're probably right but yeah great to be here again let's see how everything works can everyone hear us uh can everyone hear us my favorite host says IM very very sweet thank you we even have a viewer from Brussels last in Russell says sounds amazing so um I guess yeah so what are we going to be talking about today lomberg many things have been happening in EU world of course um I think one of one of which is the biggest one uh was revealed yesterday with the new Commissioners uh we're going to be talking about all of that of course um but nonetheless there's also some smaller things like our good friend Cher Britton friend of the show Almost a mascot no I'm I'm king of course and uh a little a little bit about the Brandenburg elections which um you're going to help us with most neber just because I am lost on local German elections um so I think I think I I got everything didn't I did I miss something did I oh no let's let's jump right into it so uh Commissioners right Commissioners uh yeah sure yeah I'll share the I'll share the commissioner screen here we go it's from yeah I think you can see everything uh perfect so by the way while we are sharing this uh a little bit of advertisement this is all in a video we released this morning so if you want the short version of this I mean don't leave obviously but if you want the short version afterwards we also have a video on this but nonetheless today is all about jumping in you know a bit more detail so so maybe maybe Elliot is a what what do you think what do you think of the massive unveil from Ursa thunderline yesterday basic basically these 26 Commissioners on the screen what what do you think um well um I think the first interesting thing is the amount of renew we we can see I think that was a interesting interesting fact um I think we definitely can talk about that and the other thing is that we have a new um commission as well uh EU defense which I looked a little bit into so we can talk about that as well um by Lithuania if I'm not mistaken yeah Andreas kubilius yeah and maybe just to get the audience on board so what you're seeing here is the the Commissioners that were elected elected yesterday not elected but presented by Ursa ferline yesterday so the top line at the very top I just want to make sure everyone understands that's Ura ferline I mean everyone should know her she's the president of the European commission and then the row below you see six Commissioners below her and these are the Executive Vice Presidents quite a mouthful of the European commission that she presented yesterday and you can see also what their portfolios are so basically what they're going to be working on hope you can see it if you zoom in and then below we have another oh God let me check my math 20 yes correct 20 Commissioners no vice presidents just Commissioners from different countries in the European Union with their respective portfolios and lastly very quickly the flags are you know the country they're from and you can also see a little color next to each of the Commissioners which is basically the political group that they're from so yeah so that's the overview really um just to make sure we're all on board and by the way very quick note before I give it back to you OT is it's not confirmed yet this is what Fine's proposing Y and I mean the next step is the European Parliament still has to vote this into in favor right so that's that's the process yes um is there any risk like I know there there's like this um almost like an exam the Commissioners have to take uh in order to to get the role um but do we like what is the rate of that failing that's just a question that just popped into my mind I have no idea what what that would be I feel like most most of these who get like their uh portfolio will get it right or am I wrong about that I think I mean you're Jumping In The Deep End right so um already there's two Commissioners on the screen which I think are definitely in danger of losing their their portf their portfolio maybe also even the their commissioner role and they will be exchanged so we'll get into those two a bit later I don't want to spoil the surprise okay yeah yeah no no sorry yeah that's my bad yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so we'll get to that um but I mean why don't we start what do you think Ian let's start with Executive Vice Presidents is there is there one here that stands out to you where you're surpris or would you like I mean let's let's start there we don't have to talk about Ursula we know who she is yeah uh well uh I think the obvious choice to talk about here would be uh Mr sour or sour uh from France uh because he's the the person that replaced or let's say um is the the the second choice for Cherry Britton um on prosperity and Industrial strategy which was I guess the biggest drama that we've heard surrounding this entire topic for the past few days you talking about the top right right the top right yeah the top right also um here is a oh no actually never mind I was about to I was about to roast you but uh but I'm not going to anymore because I I realized it was it was my own fault all right uh yeah so stefanon who uh is there instead of T Bron um and I think that's the the biggest one of these I mean of course I'm a uh I'm a bit of a fan of Kaya kalas but that's because um I don't know I I really liked her stances and her her rhetoric when it came to the war in Ukraine um I I I know that there's definitely some things that people inside of Estonia don't like her for uh but I only kind of evaluate her on foreign policy so that's why I kind of like her and the rest I'll be honest I don't really know that much so those two stand out for me you haven't done your research before this live stream Elliot I have I I have but on to I guess more irrelevant irrelevant people um so I mean Kaya kalas maybe let's dive into her a little bit she's from Estonia she is the uh foreign affairs and security policy Chief which is basically the the foreign policy well I think you called the high representative in the European Union yep and she basically um yeah Miss borell there we go Villa mentioned it exactly so she's basically a foreign policy for the EU and she used to be the prime minister right of Sonia ofia if I'm not mistaken yeah Y and what really surprises me Elliott is um Eastern European countries they really got went strong on foreign policy and defense because if you look at the defense um defense commissioner andreos kilios he is from Lithuania so that's another Baltic State yeah wonderful pronunciation as well very impressive okay yeah yeah but um I mean on the top we can dive into it instantly or we can first talk about the vice president here um because it's actually interesting we we spoke or I spoke with the um what was the title again lead spokesman for the um for the commission of Foreign Affairs and security policy uh so I guess like a you could see it as a colleague of Miss Callas um like last week in on the live stream so it was uh that was very interesting and he spoke a bit about the the tasks and and everything that they do there um so what's your challenge give us a bit come on ell give us a bit of detail what's what's what what is she to do the next couple years uh so what surprised me a lot is that um well we read Foreign Affairs uh but of course Foreign Affairs is a competency mostly of the member states themselves not of the European Union uh only they only with the um what's it called the The veto power right so the so everyone has to agree um on anything related to Foreign Affairs and security policy so a big part of the job uh that Miss K is going to have is not only to uh be representing EU outside of the European Union but also getting the multiple different member states to all agree on the same topics which is um a difficult task let's just say that sometimes especially when um you know you have 20 27 different member states on all of these all with a different opinion um and yeah that's going to be a big big part of her of her task getting everyone to agree on a single thing which is not impossible but it's definitely not easy yeah no I agree that's the big one especially when you have I mean I hate to bring them up every time but if you have someone like Orban doing trips to Russia to a pece piece is a strong word but to meet with with Vladimir Putin and then flying over to China then flying over to the states basically pretending to be the high representative himself rather than borell I guess now kala kayak kalas yeah yeah that's a good question by by embra actually um he said both K kaas and vun the one from the lady from Finland uh also a vice president both have Security in their title so who's responsible for what kind of security um and looking at yeah actually that's a good question I first thought it was because uh Kaaya kalas will be looking more at security policy on Foreign Affairs so uh internationally exact and viun would be more for the internal uh stuff in the European Union it's actually a brilliant question because I I think that's what it is what you just said Elliot but I'm not 100% sure and by the way a lot of what these portfolios are is a bit of speculation because what they're going to do now I mean if they get approved is you know write their what their priorities are within that portfolio of course I mean yes there is a lot in Ora F lines big speech already but it's going to be more detail later um so yeah yeah I think it's a it's that's like more of a metad discussion on this entire thing but like creating a commission for every single country really gets you um get you with some strange competencies or like overlap some times where every single member State needs to get their own commission um you get some double some some double up including maybe in this case sorry ell to interrupt you you say that but look at the Belgian colleague so if you go here laip the Belgian one yeah um she has preparedness and crisis management okay I can imagine that's you know if the EU is in crisis maybe a CO crisis or you know not the co but like you know basically a crisis that she has to like manage that and prepare the union for it and then she has a quality so that's like two completely different things so it's almost like well we kind of have to expand as a union because apparently we have more topics to cover yeah yeah just keep just keep throwing things in there I mean yeah some people are making some like uh AA saying cyber security for uh vun and and then IM rightley also says internal stuff I meant internal security but that could also go into the commissioner for internal affairs I I think we have one right uh um internal wait one second mediteran I mean there's also uh maros from Slovakia with economic security which is also another security I'm just thinking it out here yeah so normally the way it also works is that the Executive Vice Presidents uh so basically the top six they will have like multiple Junior Commissioners working underneath them right so for example I assume that um Andreas kubos will be working a lot with kayak kalas you know underneath her and the same would could be said from bco hookstra the Dutch one he's got climate Net Zero clean clean growth he'll be working a lot with Teresa Ribera Rodriguez from Spain so you know you can already see that are certain pillars yeah and I could also see um Mr Mr Costas cadis from Cypress also being part of that um if we're talking about all those stuff yeah a little bit it's a little bit less of course because like fishery is a big thing like as a as a as a trade of of hunting fish but I can also Imagine um some overlap being there of the the health of oceans and seas around the European Union right yeah yeah yeah no exactly and maybe I like the comment that Villa made she he's talking about Teresa rera Rodriguez so let's be honest she got a massive portfolio I I don't think clean just and competitive transition I mean with thunder Line's ambition of uh of hitting the 2050 and well climate neutrality right that first and that secondly re also for a second term I mean that's how she got the green to vote for her so it's obviously still a big part of her agenda and yeah she got it Teresa got it which um I'm not sure if it was a surprise let us know in the comments Villa if you think it's a surprise but um it's definitely um a big portfolio for Spain I mean she did used to be the Deputy Prime Minister I guess in in Spain but um yeah I mean what do you think what do you think any any comments on on her uh on on Teresa uh on me personally no congratulations to her I guess uh Villa says uh very funny to oh very funny to hear you pronounce Spanish names of the French are it was for people outside Spain but Spanish government said it was certain yeah um her first announcements was that she won't be anti-nuclear which I think is a pretty good thing yeah I think I think so too I think this whole anti-nuclear stance I mean me as an opinion talking as lomus I think it's um yeah I don't think we should be anti-nuclear especially considering we have no natural very few natural resources for energy talking about you know gas things like that I think we should look at Alternatives not just Renewables but also things like Nuclear So I mean we're getting off topic but yeah I agree with yeah so um I want I want to I want to talk a little bit about um our our our friend or well maybe not friend but Cherry Bron um and this new replacement because I there's like some there was some interesting things uh hey there he is um there were some interesting things happening surrounding surrounding his uh I guess commissionership um that that that surprised me uh really I mean for for those that don't know um I I guess I think most people watching here do know him but Bon um he he played a a big role in a lot of EU policymaking especially on uh multiple digital stuff that's why he got some enemies as well especially um Mr Elon Musk uh because he's been very vocally unhappy about Mr brto on Twitter uh still refusing to call it X um and yeah it is his resignation he was very unhappy um he criticized Ura publicly even accusing her of um plotting against his re um personally plotting against his reappointment which um was uh interesting a little maybe a look into the The Depths or the the labyrinths of EU EU um the EU what you call it so it was it was two big things right like after the election of ferline the election within the EP party so everyone ferine is from the EP EP group the blue color you can see uh she had a couple of within the EP party vote against her so she didn't get 100% of the vote and the first thing that Brar did was literally make a post on Twitter saying well not sure if Wonder should be president again dude he's your B she's your boss man what how did you think that was a good idea and then anyway and then there was a second scandle with peeper you know Piper gate yeah yeah anyway long story short that was basically a ferine appointed someone without consulting Breton although it was in breton's area and uh yeah there was a lot of backlash and especially from Breton against thunderline so that pissed thunderline off even more and yeah yeah and then yeah you had these um I mean he he accused um wait I think one of his quotes was um you asked France to withdraw my name for personal reasons that in no instance you have discussed directly with me and offered as political tradeoff an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future college so maybe macron and or France weren't happy with the portfolio they were going to get so they sacrificed Britton in in in like a as a trade off for a higher EXA commissioner Place yeah so this happened on uh on Monday so yeah because everyone thought Braton was going to get the position on the top right or at least a position right and then ferline made a secret like just like you said secret deal with I mean that's what the speculation is with macron yeah yeah I mean what other like I mean secret secret deal yeah maybe well we will we will probably never know or at least not for a while um but I I found that very interesting and like there's um let's say I I wrote a news article uh from euron news and they they quoted it as saying um Britton was not the first to challenge the crown the crown referring to Queen Ursula very very well put um but basically they go into detail how multiple people try to like um yeah well they call it challenge so I guess maybe criticize or not always being uh going through the same the same door as is U Miss urula of Miss V excuse me um like France timmermans uh he was the Dutch uh executive for the for the the vice president for the for the green deal and he went to he retired or retired he left European politics to go pursue his own career in National politics running for the Parliamentary elections um but he was also very vocal about not really liking V the lion um he gave her little to no support uh even Mr Bell who has already been mentioned also chesti chastized from their line for um for handling in the Israel Ms War yeah um and even like his his term is also ending soon so he's going to be going out um Nicholas Schmidt uh who was the lead candidate for the from the Socialist apparently uh ran against one line um but he also wasn't very happy I mean in in in short there's many people who are leaving EP is taking control of the commission as you can see through all of these uh light blue colors that's EP right if I'm not mistaken on your image yeah the light blue is Yeah so basically um they they were alluding to ur being like having a very strong position because so many were from her own party and her biggest critics I guess could say um have either left or have been defitely put put aside um in the in the in the politics yeah it's her commission right you can notice that she definitely did Stamper Authority and I think it's a good question here from from Villa is oh God I'm going to have to pronounce his name man it's going to be completely wrong seor okay there we go is se's position right now more powerful that what what Britton was so Bron's previous position was um what was it internal internal Market I think yes uh it was the internal Market exactly and now uh saidj has industrial strategy so I I honestly think this is like a again I could be wrong but I speculate this is a dream come true because if you know macron he's been stamping home industrial sovereignty throughout like the last years so this is something our portfolio he really wants and that's why I really buy into the speculation that he made a back door or back room deal with f lines like okay we'll kick Bretton out and we'll put another one of my little minions because let's be honest Sor is a minion of mron yeah yeah exactly into into the Executive Vice President position um for do for doing industrial strategy he is he's worked yeah he's a close Ally of of macron's so works out for him and yeah in that sense it kind of you could kind of see how it happened right where um mcon really wanted his position Miss F offered it him for a price and he was happy to pay the price that is the speculation okay nothing of this is confirmed but that's the idea of it oh yeah someone uh oh empa asks what's the color coding these are the color coding is the the color of the uh European groups that these these people belong to so uh yellow is renew uh light blue is EP uh red is is snd I'm just assuming here uh that just makes sense in my head uh gray is independent I would say and then the last is per oh yeah lost two lost two even oh yeah oh yeah okay dark blue yeah yeah I I would say a purple is for the Patriots that will be my guess yeah yeah we're gonna talk about that we are going to talk about that but go ahead yeah and dark blue would be then uh I know ECR is the final one yeah because there was one ECR position yeah oh and by the way who whoever whoever there's one mistake in this image and whoever can guess that mistake you get special I don't know what what do you get you get a free month of patreon whoa big I was going to say big shout out on the screen but there's a big there's a massive mistake in there I can't believe I messed that up but you know when you're working late on a video you you make mistakes so anyone who can get it let me know so yeah maybe maybe talk about that uh Elliot moving to the next topic the top left we have rapael that's probably the terrible Italian pronunciation but he's from Italy yeah and he is from the ECR so obviously that makes sense Maloney's uh party um is the ECR in the European Parliament what do you think of this pick an ECR person doing cohesion and reforms so okay there's two parts of this part one is for the portfolio he received I think uh I would have wanted to see someone else there me personally but for getting a ECR person in general into the commission I think is a pretty smart move um because let's let's think about the or like like let's think back to the last um Parliament elections few months ago or at least so probably yeah a few months ago um the right wing won pretty big just in general like everything further to the right than e they won okay um so I think it is maybe to get a bit more legitimacy it is a smart move uh to include someone from the right wing um to maybe get a bit more democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the I guess General citizenry of the European Union so in that case I think it might be an allright move but yeah go ahead you probably have an opinion on this as well I I I I I do agree with your point I mean I I don't think it's bad at all to have you know a bit of proportional representation Al in the Commissioners for me the the where I get nervous is when I see his portfolio so again I don't know enough um cohesion okay that should be fine but reforms is what I'm concerned about because I am not gonna as lomus again not as EMA simple as lomus I I think we don't we don't have to say it every time yeah I know I know but um I just want to make clear I feel that um I feel reform is very important for the EU right so I think removing the veto vote for example is a a really important thing to do I know I'm not sure how much influence he does to to stop that or to to start that because there is already a proposal going through the Parliament and now the council but having an ECR person in charge of reforms yeah I mean they are called European conservatives and reformists so they do want reform but the kind of Reform they want is probably yeah it's a different kind of Reform exactly so that's why I'm a bit nervous about the reform part I would have preferred him to have another portfolio yeah yeah so I I really wonder how um like what happened in the in the back rooms there where he got cois reforms because like you said I don't think Okay it definitely doesn't help that Mr fito is on reforms when you want to try and pass Europe European reform in the getting rid of veto rights sense because uh looking at the ECR standpoints that's like almost exactly opposite of I believe what they want I'm pretty sure so in that sense if you are for that uh European reform for getting rid of the veto but all like all the other I think pretty interesting things that's included in this in this reform idea um that is all probably well I don't say I don't want to say not going to happen because like you said it's it's right now with the with the parliament but it's um the council definitely gon the council even sorry uh it's it's definitely not gonna help right so yeah yeah I love Damon's Topic damah in the comments thank you for that comment I think ECR should have gotten defense since ECR wants a United EU Army and defense alongside National armies so um I'm not saying that we should have a United EU Army but I think ECR one of their strongest points in their portfolio which sets them apart y from the Patriots and the sovereignists is their focus on defense and I thought I really think that I completely agree I think that would have been a very cool portfolio for them to have but that went to andreos kilios from Lithuania yeah and um well okay yes yeah you're right uh the only thing I wanted to add still was um that also ECR is uh pretty Pro Ukraine if I'm not mistaken so I think that in in that case it could have been very fitting uh as well as it pretty much aligns with what like the the current EU is uh policies are but yeah I I guess it's wait wait and see what um Mr fto says his his public statements his policy I'm very curious what he's going to be doing I I I I wonder Elliot I really wonder if it's not more I mean by the way I agree with the comments he is good he was the Prime Minister I think of Lithuania at some point this Andreas two times even two times even like yeah exactly so he's he's obviously a strong pick and I like Eastern countries picking up I I can talk AIT a bit more about him okay you talk about him you talk about him yeah yeah go ahead let's talk about him yeah sure so um yeah Mr kuus is um from EP and two times prime minister um and he is very famous or at least um to the people that that know him as a pretty pretty staunch anti Russian guy so Russian Hawk very much on the side of sending more a to Ukraine um beefing up defense for Europe so in in that sense um it is kind of looking pretty good if you if you agree with those with those statements of sending more Aid to Ukraine um investing more in defense in Europe just in general and the most important thing is he is the first ever uh of defenses end space right because it's a new a new portfolio um I Al I wrote some other things down were interesting uh yeah so his his tasks I think is more the most important part here so he would be charged with um with stepping up the production capacity of the BLS military industrial complex as you as some of you might know we promised Ukraine 1, 150 millimeter shells uh a while back and we promised to do that within a year but that didn't really uh work work out um and it was largely because we don't have the industrial capacity to do that anymore so that is like one of the biggest topics um that he's going to be in charge of let's see what else I I wrote down um I love the research Elliot good man list yeah listen I I I I I come prepared okay think very seriously um yeah so and other things which I thought was kind of interesting would be the uh and it sounds very futuristic the European Sky Shield um which would work similarly if people know it uh the the Iron Dome in Israel al much uh talked about basically the air defense Shield of Israel a similar system like is being or people want to create in Europe so that in the event of any missiles airplanes that shouldn't be there that European cities are safe uh uh what what are you what are you typing there in chat nothing I'm just I'm just engaging our audience Elliot I'm engaging our audience okay okay um very good yeah and then uh what else oh yeah a big part was the the new I guess yeah the defense uh Industry Program this a new roll out so he's going to be working with that I mean in in general the entire theme Here is that he is um let's say he uh the goals are very high the Ambitions are very high but the budget isn't very big so um he like people are or like Ura ask is asking a lot of this of this man but the budget is just not there uh and neither is much of the legal framework that is necessary for many of the things that that are wanted so many see this as like um yes it's a good thing um but like without the the without the uh sorry uh the budget and without the laws in place it's kind of um it's very hamstrung right it's it's handicapped in a sense that he can't do everything that he would probably want to set out and do uh which is yeah which is a sad thing uh in this case I I I believe so yeah I also wonder how much of that position is like a symbolic one and how much of is like a real position because like let's be honest defense is just not a competency of the EU so what that means is the EU doesn't have the responsibility to defense it still lies solely with the member states right yes we can do shared procurement we can do stuff like that but it's very limited just like you pointed out and budget like you mentioned is also a good point and I I even remember just the third point now is not only those two it is also that um countries member states are also pretty relu on some of these things like especially the largest the EU Powerhouse uh Germany is also very icy reluc on all of this new uh let's let's say military talk of of increasing weapons increasing spending uh more guns you know bigger armies integration um in all in all of communication Germany has always been a bit more um careful on the military side and I wonder why that is uh of World War II is the answer of course yeah yeah I live in Germany so I I notice it like a lot of people are very very reluctant even when it comes to military aid to countries like Ukraine yeah we have a sorry sorry we got a question in the chat so from Gareth Brown e made simple how can it be that Ora's commission if she doesn't get to select the Commissioners surely the president knows one person each country of the EU so I think I think the G's question is like why does she not get to elect them herself and I mean again it's probably in the EU I can answer it if if that's right it's probably in the EU treaties that the way it works is that the country proposes a candidate ferline you know talks with the country and can maybe try to change it but really it's a country's responsibility and then she gets to then allocate portfolios so it's like a balance of power almost um but also very a very strong negotiating position right so like just like what we just talked about with um with brto and that is like directly involved with Fon um yeah Sor yeah I mean imagine that like she she has the power from the line to basically be like well I don't like your candidate so either replace the candidate or I'm G to give that candidate terrible portfolio something that basically means they're going to be doing very little for five years and we'll get into it in a minute there is someone on this screen that has a very bad portfolio anyone who can get in the comments gets another oh here we go can get gets another got other patreon us anyway sorry OT you g yeah no I I I just of course big shout out to Mr Von for the two BGN which is Bulgarian currency I mean it it starts with a B so I'm just guessing that's Bulgarian currency but thank you very much and he says naive stance given that Russia is a fascist State okay uh I I what is that referring to I don't know what that refers to BJC what what are you referring to what yeah no the message is clear but yeah what was the what was the referring to so what what are people saying well one two there's a couple that got it right it was too easy wasn't it it was too easy do you know you know who we're referring to right Elliot Cory oh the the bad position yeah yeah should we talk about him now should we talk about him sure sure yeah hungry right no God why am I laughing so loud um you want to you want to give an introduction about Olivier valer or should I explain who he is V yeah okay now I I'll tell you what I know about him which is a lot so it's going to be not not love talking for me so Mr veli um has the uh portfolio of health and Animal Welfare which okay uh I want to make fun of however um certain people very close to me really care about Animal Welfare so I can't make too much fun of it okay uh but I guess in general you would consider that as a portfolio that um doesn't really have a lot of influence within European union and I guess I like my suspicion here is that Hungary in this case got punished for their demeanor and behavior throughout the F the past years uh so miss miss Ursa just gave them here have health and Animal Welfare enjoy goodbye yeah that's what I that's what I that's what I think at least yeah yeah yeah and it's not just that um velli is also um very disliked by the EU so it's not just Mr Orban excuse me that beer is going down interestingly anyway it's not just Mr Orban um it's also uh vareli who is not exactly well-liked in the European Parliament he's got caught with quite a few quite a few scandals um but yeah the the well scandals yeah anyway the big one of course like you mentioned is orbon who's obviously a very very difficult character and um he put forward Oliver varelli and he's the only Patriot person on this page so on on the on the page so you know whoever has been living under a rock the Patriots are a new political group in the European Parliament um and they are led by Orban and Leen um basically it's their party their group and he is the only one on here from from that group so so yeah um he's obviously a contentious contentious choice and not liked by the Parliament and Elliot he's our first candidate who might even with that portfolio get this how do you call it um voted down by the European Parliament right because he he doesn't have any expertise in that area or what well why they they just don't really like him I mean there's loads I mean I've got to open here there's a couple of things he's done so yeah so he's had a investigation against him by the parliament uh about re breaching commission code of conduct because he was in the commission last five years too I maybe May should have mentioned that he was broke the code of conduct yeah that's what the parliament says in what way do you know uh let me let me read one second uh ser yeah he was play so basically he was playing down Serbia's rule of law backsliding and supported like a separatist uh action in Bosnia H yeah and velli obviously called it fake news then in 2023 during a parliamentary debate about the Western Balkans varelli was caught on the mic saying how many idiots are still left so certified bad boy okay quite the character and then quite after the Hamas attack against is Vari then basically said that all payments to the Palestinian authorities should be suspended immediately so that's a bit controversial because some people would see that as a good thing some would not see that as a good thing yeah and then yeah there's blackmail accusations oh God there's a lot man the list goes on figure yeah yeah okay but imagine that right last the last portfolio you had I think was enlargement I think it was enlargement yeah it was enlargement that was the last five years and now he got Animal Health Care Health welfare sorry yeah so it's quite so yeah in that sense it is quite quite the uh the punishment then um which is fun well I mean I guess maybe that's kind of orban's middle finger back is sending the guy who has been I guess breaking code like being the bad boy in in in the commission already so they just yeah have have him again good luck yeah yeah exactly exactly interesting uh yeah yeah yeah some questions I guess from or do you want to say anything else sorry I think another massive portfolio is P sarapin from Poland yes he's got budget which I think is a big one and you already mentioned it earlier uh the EU needs money it needs money yeah so he is and he's the one that's basically putting it forward and let me let me ask you a a question Elliot I'm gonna put you on the spot do you think the EU should borrow money you know like EU together together you know something that France would love and Germany would hate so yeah and the Netherland also would hate so the The Frugal was Frugal four Frugal five one of those two um yeah so okay if you're putting me on the spot I'm a quite the Euro file all right so um I'd say in general um more integration more good however okay I said it with a big caveat I have not looked into the economic um consequences of sharing debt and what that would inail so mine is just based on feeling uh so just basically take that with a large large bucket of salt uh my opinion there but yeah that's my take right right right right yeah because the German perspective here is very much against they're they're worried I mean you have to give the Germans one thing and that is that they are quite um conservative I guess at managing their money and their debt to GDP ratio is among the best in Europe right for a big country like Germany it's very very good I think it's only 60% so basically Max is 80 right like or like the the the max amount of depth to GDP ratio is 80% if I'm not mistaken no France is at 110 yeah okay okay they agreed or they the the the point that they want to go to is 80% that's the I think that's the the one sweet sweet spot I guess no like that's the the I think they wrote it like it's law or maybe not law or maybe the there's no people are going over it something actually the law for joining the Euro so for example Bulgaria Romania all these countries that maybe want to join the Euro they have to have less than 60% GDP it's 60 there you go maybe that's what I'm thinking of yeah so Germany's actually quite within the rules of the Euro Zone yeah but then again Germany's growing currently with like minus 0.2% right and if they invested I mean if you increase your debt by 1% and you grow by 1% then your is still at 60% right that might have been terrible math but I think it is yeah listen that sounds good to me okay I'm terrible numers okay have someone fact Checker in the chat yeah I love I love you got fact Checkers like the more beer we drink Elliot the the worse our facts are gonna get yeah the worse our math is going to get for certain uh yeah okay yeah so yeah a little bit no we could talk a little bit more about sarapin um because he is is uh I think he's probably a very very influential person right now because not only does he um is is he in charge of the budget a very big thing is also he's um in charge of The Blocking funds due to the violations of the rule of law he is part of being able to decide on on that so um Mr Mr Orban is going to be looking at this guy um maybe pre like Poland very famous uh previous bad boy of the European Union maybe a bit more reformed now after Donald T Victory um but yeah he has the power now also to block especially blocking the funds to Hungary which was like a was it like a total of 22 billion uh and like half of it is still still frozen something like that so he's he's going to be in charge of that which is a a very like it's one of the main correction measures that the European Union has to to like kind of re in the Bad actors within the European Union so that's a very big a very very big thing um this is the guy I looked into a little bit as well and he was like he's like a big experienced guy when it comes to European politics uh because he was right now he's the the Polish ambassador to the European Union uh but that's going that's going to change obviously uh before that he was the the uh Chief of Staff to Donald Tusk um when he was the head of the European Council after that he went into uh he was a director of Transport telecommunications and energy at the Council of the EU uh eu's General General Secretariat um and then he also had a a quick a quick saying a quick job is a bit redundant or like um diminishing but uh he also served as the Secretary of State of European Affairs at the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs so he's basically the big EU guy okay he's like a lot lot of experience with EU um and that kind of I guess it makes a lot of sense for tus to send him to um the commission and yeah uh all right I think the talk was that because tusk was a um a big supporter of Wonder lion second term uh he got the budget uh position as a like quote unquote reward right um especially because there there's there's going to be a new fiscal year coming up um which takes seven years and I feel like that's uh yeah like the something like that so it's it's definitely an important position and yeah that's what I about it I mean this is also a massive topic right and I I really think actually talking about it maybe it's worth a live stream or even a video Yeah talking about eu's resources because the EU currently mainly gets its money by member States paying into the EU yes right and what does it mean it does it means that member states have a lot of power in the EU basically the council the council has so much power the EU member states and if you change that if you get the resources so the M the EU is financed by another means I mean I'm not saying taxes or on us but there's there's loads of other ways you know taxing multinationals it doesn't matter that would be more beneficial because and the EU has more power to act on it by itself independent of the member states which would be a preferable model for many uh yes and also like I mean many of the things that we're talking about now you have to keep in mind that the amount of budget the European Union has to do all of these things compared especially to like a country or I mean United States China to these other similarly sized countries with this like roughly the same amount of population is very small like the the the the budget the EU itself has is is compar comparatively very little because like you said most of the money still lays with the member states and they're heavily dependent on what the member states want to do and stuff like that so when we're talking uh about the the defense and space commission he is he's totally screwed because the the the budget of uh research and development in in in defense in the America is like I okay comparing it to America obviously the biggest military spender by far on the planet maybe he not the best comparison but still it's it's it's it's magnitudes magnitudes bigger so yeah yeah also bonus brownie points to anyone in the chat that can guess where most EU money goes to what area oh yeah I know this question yeah it's quite simple question but let's see let's see if the chat knows um oh by the way here the poll in the chat shows that most people would prefer to have uh common EU debt which is interesting interesting not many Germans in the chat then not very no neither was it like Germany Netherlands Denmark and another uh Austria swed it Frugal State yeah The Frugal States Sweden and or Austria one of those yeah people are saying people are already guessing it yeah agriculture it's it's agriculture by far so yeah yeah it's agriculture very important by the way Elliot you mentioned Austria should we have a look at the commissioner for AUST I also thought this was interesting mag not sure you know him where is he where is he right side there he is magnos Bruna Bruna yes he's a finance guy um uh that's I know a little bit more about him but that's about about it but I'm very interested in his portfolio Internal Affairs and migration very big one it is a very it's a massive one but I I almost laughed when I saw it because I mean Austria is known for for you know when it comes to migration not exactly being the most Cooperative right I mean look at sh remember sh blocked or Romanians close your close your ears okay if there's any bulgarians or Romanians in the chat they're probably like want to quit the EU now that Austria has got Internal Affairs in migration yeah I feel bad for them it's it honestly made me laugh it really made me laugh um and then migration too I mean you know Austria they're very very very anti migration which maybe that's a good new approach to have like a very anti-immigration country taking that portfolio because it is an issue in Europe of course and many farri parties are growing because of it maybe that's good but I still think it's funny I mean what it is yeah no so I I kind of I this kind of is in the same area as giving the ECR and the Patriot for Europe a seat uh at the T at the suppos table here I think putting someone who's quite big um anti- migration like hard stance on migration might be a way of urla to appease the the the rising right vote and of course migration like let's not pretend it's not a not a big issue because it definitely is it's everywhere people are it's like one of the biggest topics that's being talked about today um so I I kind of see that as a way of of Vera trying to appease those people okay see okay I put a I put a hardliner on migration please calm down please don't come for me uh I'm trying here I I at least that's how reading it yeah yeah you might be right you might be right I just I just feel a little bad for Romanian Bulgarian friends oh I absolutely do yeah yeah the way the way Austria blocked I mean literally Romania and Bulgaria I made two videos on this topic and yeah the amount of GDP and money they're losing from not being in shenen is insane like literally I think it was like 1.6 or two% per year and now Jesus yeah and now they've got like what did I think they've got air shenen and sea shenen but still not land shenen and that means at the border is that's the big one like come on guys they gave them uh they gave them uh air Inc as like a as a as like a Band-Aid measure to to show them hey guys look we're you're making progress but like most I want to say like this is a number I pull out my out of my behind Okay but um I I I'm pretty sure 90 90 plus percent of that trade is going through the land borders anyways with the European Union course I mean they do have a port Romania has a port quite a big one I mean there is lots of conspiracies right that um that there's reasons why some EU countries don't want Romania in Shen because of their port what's the port called again I can't remember but there's a big port with lots of trade coming in yeah on the on the duu uh NE River anyway anyway so so there was rumors that the Netherlands blocked Romania's entry for a long time because they didn't want their port reram to be challenged right um but I mean it's conspiracies it's no there's no facts there it's just yeah uh they say people are saying yeah Conant okay Conant yeah but uh the Netherlands lifted their block right uh a little while back yeah is it still just Austria being difficult Romania is Austria and Bulgaria I think is Austria and Romania for full excess again if there's bulgarians in the chat please correct me but I think that was it right yeah well I I hope that isn't this like on the right like wasn't there me some plans of saying yeah d we're getting there I promise 2024 2025 is going to happen trust us come on guys a little bit longer as as commissioner that was before before him okay [ __ ] anyway we'll see we'll see we'll see I'll see yes at this Fen says in chat at this point turkey will join the EU before Bulgaria and Romania join lanching in well who who's doing enlargement let's have a look at enlargement Marta Co from Slovenia yeah oh I can't I've G to be honest I don't really know her at all really do you know her wait wait wait wait wait uh uh but renew so it shouldn't be that bad in the sense in the sense of I I guess they're a bit more open and liberal for that okay actually the the the interesting thing is I mean I don't know why I'm saying this now but anyway Hungary has the presidency at the moment and one of their goals was to move forward with with uh with with enlargement so that's interesting anyway random comments interesting interesting probably not for the for for Ukraine but Pro definitely not for Ukraine I think it was the Western Balkans where they were talking about anyway side comment yeah yeah sorry politics for fun I am biased I am my own person yeah she's from n so she doesn't suck I that's that's politics for fun paraphrasing me because basic that's basically what I said in in in other words no like uh I I honestly don't know um I don't know her so I don't know her stances on it so I I I I couldn't um I couldn't retail uh yeah I mean you're talking about renew so I just changed the screen a little bit I mean what do you when you see this is is impressive it is impressive isn't it for renew I mean yeah yeah for renew yeah it is I wonder how like this is the times where I wish to be a fly somewhere in these negotiation Chambers just listen in because I wonder how they they managed to do this to get um to get this uh to get five people into the commission whilst they became fifth in the parliament elections right yeah they did they came fifth yeah I mean that's that's insane right that a party that came fifth has the second most government spots I mean that's almost what really the commission is really for me just to make it simpler is is the government of the EU if you ask me right it's like ministers almost yeah it is it is yeah yeah and they basically came Fifth and uh in the in the elections and they got the second most spots but again I guess that's just how coalitions work right yeah yeah and snd only four this is a very right very right leaning commission it there is a big mistake sorry to interrupt there's a big mistake there the snd has five because one person in the ep the Romanian lady she moved over to snd so snd and renew Europe have the same did she move uh did she move recently or is that just a mistake on it's me at 2 a.m. in the morning um fair enough okay you know kind of like overseeing that I I actually double checked twice and I still oversaw it so it happens to the best of us you don't blame yourself too yeah so apologies everyone watching um yeah but like still five I mean snd became was second largest or third yeah they were second they were second in yeah St wrecked and look at these guys this I think is quite hilarious too the greens yeah didn't get anyone even though they supported line but I guess they governments there's no green government in Europe at the moment so I guess that's why but still the left also not I mean if if you are I I mean people people will say what they want but I feel like if you're a right-wing person then I think you can be quite decently happy with with the results here I mean it's all center right EP obviously and renew is Center like liberal uh so probably not the biggest fan of those if you're like a a Patriots for Europe voter but still I mean in general it's it's definitely leaning right you and then but by the way you make the chat makes awesome points right I mean we I know this guys like we both know this it's it's the governments sending the them so it's based in the government in the country but nonetheless it's still uh very interesting to look at I think yeah yeah cool uh I mean I think I I said in the beginning that we were planning on talking a bit about brunberg as well like do you want to you want to fly you want you want to fly through there as well because I know you like you don't have much time left yeah let's have a look okay let's maybe I can go a bit longer let's look at one more picture I thought this was interesting too yeah because I wanted to ask you this what you think about this so basically what I'm showing here everyone and definitely watch this video after the after the stream after the live stream it shows the commissions the European commission again but it shows women compared to men so one of under's main import wait wait wait hold hold on hold on hold on sorry to interrupt you um someone what was the mistake in the the the list of things I don't think we mentioned did we oh we didn't it was Romania so it was um me putting the Romanian um commissioner so I'll go back here let me so for anyone oh we need to look who got the mistake right first but basically yeah I don't know who did roana minatu she's not EP she's snd I see thisor oh I see okay is wrong is wrong it's wrong it's wrong I don't think anyone got it let's see yeah yeah I think someone did get it I'll go back in the chat and see who it was so if you're on Discord by the way whoever got it first let me know and we'll get a little prize for you otherwise we'll do a shout out next live stream oh by way any not on Discord get on Discord now it's in the description so yes very good very good all right okay so basically what I want to show here uh before we go to the last topic of the day is this is the gender balance of the commission so oh let me get it right uh come on okay here we go so basically on the left you have the ladies of the commission on the right side you have the men and um obviously ferine is a female and then you see in the executive VI pres there's four women and two men and then the rest of the Commissioners there's a lot lot less I let Yap a bit i y too much I I might talk too much sorry no no that's okay that's mean that's mean no no I I just wanted to I just wanted to let the guys in ch know that I saw think I think in these live streams uh also chat if I do talk too much just tell me to shut up because it's definitely one of my one of my problems anyway so yeah go ahead anyway all I'm trying to say is thunderline went out there with a massive statement and said I want to commission 5050 went to all the member states and said one woman one man please I want to choose between them only one member state did this it was Romania I think was the only one all the others just sent men or mainly men and now we have a commission with 11 ladies and TW nine 16 men so what do you think of this do you think it's good that you tried to set out for 50 50 or should the best person get the job on the spot Elliot wow wow lomber I I'll keep it in mind I'll take some like moral dilemas with me next time and ask you the same question uh so this is the ancient discussion of um do I think the best person should get the job I mean I think almost everyone would say yes the best person should get the job but I also don't uh I I think when we're talking about this is more referring to the discussion behind it is are these women being considered for their position for these for those positions at all so do we even know who's getting the best uh position so like I I find it very difficult to make a hard statement about because I have no idea how all these countries chose their people but in general I think a 50-50 rues a bit dumb um but I guess in this case we have a bit more of a bit more viewpoints and especially when you're looking at the VPS uh definitely women are the having the overhand there so oh yeah oh yeah they do they do yeah yeah yeah I mean in the end of the day and I'm probably going to make it is proportional representation right so I'm not saying okay interesting you're going that route I'm playing Devil's Advocate I'm playing Devil's advate because I I've read with a lot of interest the comments on the video that have be posted this morning and there was a lot of discussion about this rule of having 50/50 you know and some I mean if you do have a proportional representation system I mean 50% let's just say 50% of the population is women right so maybe they should also be presented by represented by 50% not saying I believe but that's the counter AR but is it isn't the but the commission isn't necessarily the representation is it wouldn't the representation be in the parliament which is even worse there's I think like 64% is male I think some Ohan 64 I mean I think so I might be wrong I think it was 64 something like that yeah but like if if you if we're talking about the commission I wouldn't really be okay I wouldn't really be thinking too much about representation because the parliament is or like the commission is the um let's say executive body um of the European Parliament right so I I I that's what I would respond to that and yeah I don't know it's it's difficult in general I would say I don't like any form of that discrimination so just like I I think it's equally bad to say well you're not getting the job because you're a man uh equally as bad as saying you're not getting the job because you're a woman obviously no one's saying it like that anymore but um you know in in in in in hyperbolic terms right uh yeah and and then the question is in indeed how far are you going to be taken are you going to be looking at um ethnicity as well are you going to be looking at race are you going to be looking at cultures or like religion or yeah I think it's uh it's going to be very difficult to find someone who's very um well okay maybe maybe I shouldn't say that but in in any case um I think it's it's it's fine like this um and I I think it's a let's see yeah probably good thing that a few more women got there I mean are the big the big honcho is is a lady as well so uh yeah let's put a poll I'm interested as as well yeah I put a poll already so when you see me typing I'm very interested to see what the what oh it's a big no I think let's see how they vote yeah yeah all right uh so I think to I know you want to go to brunenberg so let's let's quickly have a last look on the commission yeah Elliot what do you like closing words you happy with what she oh sorry okay so two questions are you happy with her propos with her with her vision her proposals here team team that's that's the one um and who do you think might fail the parliament when the parliament votes interesting okay so overall it's a mixed bag for myself uh I think the important positions um that mostly align with my own views like the the foreign affairs and security policy and the prosperity and Industrial strategy um even things like the budget uh and defense have all gone to people that I personally deem very capable and I generally align with their views so in that case I'm very happy the only main thing that I'm a bit if you on is the the reforms bit uh but we'll have to see how frto handles that that the thing so in general I think I'm pretty pretty all right I like for me personally could have been a lot worse um but that's because I guess I'm a bit more all right with the EP vote um personally yeah what about yourself I like who who fails uh well you already alluded to Oliver might U maybe failing I know I know that WKA probably isn't going to fail his because already passed that ex same exam um a few years back who else might fail I mean I would have to what else could be difficult so I I wouldn't know yeah who do you say who do you think will fail sorry who who will fail the parliament vote yeah so you you you're saying Hungary so I'm going to say that as well Vari I think he has chance of failing because he's got so like quite a few scandals that he might leave on yeah and uh what about uh I have no this is going to be a total guess Miss ekatarina Zahara from Bulgaria startups research and Innovation that sounds like a difficult topic um one that I would feel so maybe she would do it as well that's totally a guess based on nothing at all okay so yeah I I think fito might have a good chance of failing too I I don't think so that's logical yeah that makes sense because just because the greens the left the EP maybe sort of to an extent snd renew they might vote against him yeah no that makes sense and in the same of Olivia v v also failing I mean if he is on Animal Welfare and he's being judged by you know snd and greens and the left then I could see him probably falling falling flat on his face honestly yeah if they're not to his liking right interesting well bito so so no what is your no no no you're not gonna get a away of this what what do you think what is your what is your general Vibe I'm just before I say that I think it's interesting in the comments um Z zahar rieva from Bulgaria keeps getting mentioned but I just don't know her well enough so hey I guess right sorry I guess I that was my second prediction BGC Von is imminent here 40% he says um I don't know I need to look into it but I think I think the two most likely to fail is the Patriots candidate and the ECR candidate um because well basically the house even though there's a lot of rightwing is just a bit still weightwise a lot on the left side of the of the of the Ring anyway but you never know your feelings my feelings are those two Vito and velli okay but like about the thing in general about the Commission in general I'm not happy with Austria I think I think very capable BR he just needs a different portfolio um he's more of a finance guy anyway so bit strange that he's getting uh Internal Affairs in migration not sure what his experience is in that area I don't like that choice I am also concerned about um I told you already fto having reforms I'm a bit up not upset about but a bit disappointed and I would have actually quite like uh um liked I mean who's got energy we haven't even talked about energy yeah it's it's from Denmark uhm Jorgenson and and housing is a pretty important one as well yeah we didn't even talk about it but yeah uh so yeah I I don't know those two mainly I I guess otherwise it's it's all right I'm okay with it I quite like France having industrial strategy I think that's great because I quite like M's Vision about strategic autonomy so I think that's great um otherwise I think it's a bit weird with some of these Commissioners I'm talking too much again but like hadya from Belgium having like two different topics where it's like okay so what is she actually doing in the end so you know there's a couple of question marks I have yeah they were um they should have been disqualified they were too late with their proposal anyways so yeah uh Antonio Antonio also is bringing up uh some points against kalas being not too diplomatic he should get picked for foreign affairs uh yeah I I think I think she is but I think I think this is a done done chapter now so let's open up another discussion we will go back on this by the way so our live finalized we will but let's go to the next topic of the day uh and that is let me uh share a new a new uh yeah I'll put up our our beautiful face as well change I'm googling now I'm googling now one second let me you're good no one sees the screen anyways okay okay so now you can see this right so this is the yeah let me put it back uh yes you should be able to see this now so we're gonna have to make this quick as I do need to go but but but like very quickly for people that don't know I'm we're going to make a great video on this it's all about Brandenburg so brandenberg is a province in Germany or a um yeah a lant lant I guess is what you call in Germany and um there's elections this Sunday evening um or Sunday and Sunday evening the election results and these are the current progn like uh prognos is in German the current estimates of who will win and Elliot tell us about the IFD who's currently polling as number one who are they oh god who are they um well I guess most would classify them as far right somewhat even goes far as saying that they're uh go what was we had an interview with someone from deel and she said it was legally allowed to call them a Neo-Nazi club or something like that was something no no no there was one okay okay so be bit careful they're definitely not but there is a there is a candidate in turingan who won oh yeah sorry yeah you're right and he he himself you can classify as a Nazi because he or at least classify as a naziis bit strong but I think his ret yeah but was it that like judge Neo fascist that was it uh oh yeah politics fers asking will there be a life on Sunday and yes my dear viewer there will be one so keep your keep your eyes out on that we're going to be going through the uh the uh results live uh analyzing it with with a with a guest it's it should be fun but it's got a let's let's see this as a a little teaser for what's to come on on on Sunday so um yeah they AR day uh rather far right um Al although many people don't want to classify as such which Hey listen um it is I I don't know what to tell you um but very popular I I guess especially within the actions of uh T and ZX that we saw uh definitely a big a big rise throughout the entire country from uh maybe you know a bit more about it but I uh from my own memory they were always at the bottom of the polls every time uh in the that say five or six years ago and they've they they've skyrocketed like like crazy I think I think especially because um because of the migration discourse right uh and people really being uh being fed up with the current uh policies of the of the curent governments so in the bundes lender they won big and I feel like they're pretty big in the east of Germany me if that's if I'm wrong on that as well but yeah that's that's the a day in a nutshell of what I know yeah yeah no I think I think what's super interesting there two things you just mentioned like afd becoming potentially the biggest party in Brandenburg which they weren't last election the last election in brandenberg which was in 2019 it was the SD so the second place on the list okay for people that don't don't know SPD is Schultz's party so Schultz is the prime minister or the bundes coun in German in Germany and um and if he loses against the afd in a state in a in a in a yeah in a province where normally they were strongest or are strongest this says a lot about his chancellorship right um yes and it's not just SPD if you look at here the green so he's the SPD so Olive Schulz he's currently working with the greens and the fdp and the greens won't even hit 5% if this happens and that means if they don't hit 5% they won't even make the local government within Brandenburg so Jesus Christ yeah yeah so it's crazy it's such a like and like a vote against the current government in Germany and there is speculation whether this will happen is you know again speculation that the government could you know call it call a day call it a day if if this goes really bad as it like uh like re earlier like call election yeah right right again full disclaimer I don't think it will happen because I'm not sure if it's in their interest but there is speculation that it could if the Bren result is terrible yeah it is possible I guess interesting so but um it says uh plus three% Ford is that what is that compared with uh that's I think from the last poll I think it's not great this um yeah this this yeah yeah so I need to find let me see if I can find one that shows it against last time uh but that probably take too long one second um yeah well in general I'm seeing um the ruling Coalition like the the national ruling Coalition of the fdp the greens and the SBD right yeah the greens are involved Villa so let me have a look yeah he said SPD and sdu it's also the greens ah he said that okay yeah he said it now yeah so it's it's three parties at the moment which are in power in Brandenburg and the question is if they so the SPD and CDU look if you count that together that's about 40% and the greens won't be there that means that Coalition can can no longer work if the greens don't make their 5% yeah but then what else it looks very difficult in BW you're going to have to work at BW which is insane um yeah because everyone like uh this is a national thing right like all the other parties have excluded FD from or like working with afd yeah is that is that correct I know yeah yeah there not gonna happen they all said no but like how long are we going to not work with the afd like so during uh during the the live stream the zon and tan one elections I think we had a similar conversation about it um where many like the biggest party in the Netherlands the vbd uh like very vocally said we're not going to be working with pvv the the part the political party of heers many of you might know um we're not going to be doing that but like a few months into the negotiations they or I think even a few weeks they they they did twist and they did end up going into a coalition together with them so a similar thing might happen here um yeah feeling yeah I don't I don't think so because if they do no one will vote for them in a year's time in the national election oh yeah that's good because they're breaking so much trust if they do that you reckon is that that big of a a breach in trust yes yeah okay okay I live in Germany I know that there's people literally voting for CDU even though they don't like CDU right so CDU is currently I mean not in Brandenburg but nationally the CDU the center right party is currently pulling the highest but there's literally people voting for them only because they see them as the best chance against the afd at the moment but if then of course they break that trust and like Ally with the afd Jesus will break yeah okay that makes sense like it makes sense yeah but like in that case it sounds pretty difficult to form a coalition at least in Brandenburg uh because then it would be what's SPD CDU and BSW yeah I mean let's I mean Elliot let's park this for our next live stream so we're and Villa you are outplaying the EU Made Simple so send us that link of your amazing poll data on Discord please and everyone else please join our Discord if you haven't done so already and yeah ell any closing words um oh I just had some in my mind and now I'm completely blanking uh in general yes make sure you're going to be watching um on
